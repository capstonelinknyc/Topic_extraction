LevineJan. 3, 2018Good morning on this (somewhat) warmer Wednesday.While many New Yorkers are still returning from holiday, city and state officials are already pounding the political pavement.Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn into office for his second term on Monday, and today, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will deliver the annual State of the State address in Albany.The stakes are higher this year for the governor, a Democrat in his second term \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s up for re-election in November and may have presidential ambitions for 2020.Though Mr. Cuomo has been lauded for progressive victories \xe2\x80\x94 like tuition-free college, the legalization of same-sex marriage, a higher minimum wage and paid family leave \xe2\x80\x94 he has also faced troubles in office. He has been blamed (and blamed some more) for New York City\xe2\x80\x99s transit crisis. He has also been criticized for his response to sexual harassment allegations against one former senior aide, and for his ties to another aide who will go on trial this month to face corruption charges.In his speech this afternoon, Mr. Cuomo will lay out his vision for the state. A few of the plans he is expected to put forward:On SafetyHis gun-control proposal would take firearms out of the hands of New Yorkers who commit domestic violence crimes. One criminal justice proposal would outlaw \xe2\x80\x9csextortion\xe2\x80\x9d and revenge porn, and another would address workplace sexual harassment.On the EnvironmentSeveral environmental proposals would take action to protect New York\xe2\x80\x99s water, from the Hudson River and Long Island to Niagara Falls and our state lakes. Another plan would outline steps to fight climate change, and a separate land proposal would reduce the local property tax.On EducationHis \xe2\x80\x9cNo Student Goes Hungry\xe2\x80\x9d proposal would give students in kindergarten through college healthy meals at school. Another\nproposal would help students and graduates navigate loans and debt. He will also unveil plans to better prepare New Yorkers for the work force.The speech will begin at 1 p.m., and you can watch it online.

Not only do they need to confront questions of what pieces of infrastructure belong to that fabric -- whether street lights, broadband kiosks, parking meters or other fixtures -- but they must also consider compounding complexities such as the role of the private sector, liability issues and equity for underserved communities.\nCity procurement officials and program managers are on the front lines of these challenges. They should have a strong sense of which solutions to package together and be able to evaluate the blizzard of innovative vendor-based solutions. Crucially, they must avoid the obsolescence risk that new purchases can be quickly outdated or simply seen as faddish trends.\nAt the center of this storm -- in not one but two major cities -- is Miguel Gami\xc3\xb1o, the talented chief technology officer of New York City who I first met in his office while he was serving as San Francisco\'s CIO.\nAs we talked about his vision for the city, he filled his whiteboard with different options he might employ to fulfill his goal of bringing broadband to all city neighborhoods. Gami\xc3\xb1o brought that goal with him to New York, where he now works on the city\'s plan to achieve affordable high-performing broadband for all New Yorkers by 2025.\nIn a recent phone call, Gami\xc3\xb1o acknowledged to me the difficulty of making "hundred-year decisions often in the context of the current demands." To break down that task, we need to deconstruct the procurement challenges facing cities, starting with two primary considerations: setting the right interim goals and considering funding options.\nInterim goals:\xc2\xa0On the way to its long-term connectivity goals, a city will encounter a number of discrete opportunities that need to be prioritized. These may include community-level data dashboards, free street-level wireless hubs, improved emergency call services, smart parking meters, gunshot detectors, and noise and mobility sensors. These interim goals should prioritize not only critical new Internet-of-Things services but should also extend existing services such as community bulletin boards, 911 and 311 access, voter registration, job placement support, and housing and medical services.\nThe best procurement offices will consider ways to invite innovation and dynamic flexibility into the process. For instance, this past spring Pittsburgh issued a request for information to get help updating its 40,000 streetlights, many of which were still using conventional lightbulbs. Rather than focus the RFI on the light replacement alone, however, the city left the procurement process open to unconventional service providers that might integrate technology that could help the city monitor traffic conditions, air quality or gunshot noises, and even provide cellphone service. No project is too conventional to push toward the goal of universal connectivity.\nFunding options:\xc2\xa0Cities across the country are deciding whether to expand the scope of infrastructure spending from its more traditional role of funding streets and sewers to also include digital services and wireless access. They are also considering other revenue sources, such as advertising. In New York City, residents who could never afford data plans can now access street-level, high-speed wireless internet due to the advertising revenue sharing agreement the city worked out with the vendor for\xc2\xa0LinkNYC, the city\'s system of sidewalk broadband kiosks.\nOther cities more severely restrict advertising. While LED screens delivering ads may work for New York, Gami\xc3\xb1o says, the issue and the tradeoffs it presents remain the subject of debate in San Francisco. Those opposed to advertising often are motivated by a desire to protect the aesthetic character of neighborhoods. On the other hand, the revenues derived from advertising can provide resources to significantly improve the ability of a resident of an underserved area to access the benefits of the internet. Simply put, one person\'s aesthetics might be another\'s lifeline.\nAs cities continue to build out integrated, connected systems, they will face additional issues, among them design, the control of content delivered by devices occupying public spaces, and the use of public infrastructure for advanced cellular connectivity. A city official\'s job isn\'t to determine how to build one big digital system but rather to figure out how to define its elements. "I don\'t have to care so much about individual smart infrastructure like a smart lighting project or the smart trash can because other agencies will," Gami\xc3\xb1o says. "I have to care about helping those things interoperate with one another to exchange data and effect a smarter, seamless user experience to everyone in the public realm, to improve the way people experience New York City." He continues that work one day at a time, never losing sight of the bigger goals far down the road.\nRELATED\nTraverse City, Mich., OKs City-Owned Gigabit-Speed Network\nSan Diego, USMC Partner on Regional Smart City Initiatives\nIdaho Lawmaker Proposes Changes to IT Bid Posting Rules\nDISCUSS\nWe invite you to discuss and comment on this article using social media.\nMORE FROM Budget & Finance\nSPONSORED ARTICLES\nERP Modernization: How the Cloud Delivers Scalability, Security and Innovation\nThe Reality of the Local Government Cybersecurity Skill Gap\nGovernment No Longer Has to Choose Between Cybersecurity and Productivity\nNEWSLETTERS\nGovTech Today - Daily top stories\nFutureStructure - Weekly system engineering concepts\nPublic CIO - Weekly thought leadership\nNEWSLETTERS\nGOVTECH TODAY\nGOVTECH BIZ\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\nFUTURESTRUCTURE\nPUBLIC CIO\nDIGITAL COMMUNITIES\nSPECIAL DISTRICTS\nK-12\nHIGHER EDUCATION\nSubscribe\nABOUT\nPRIVACY\nCONTACT\nADVERTISE\nGT Logo\n\xc2\xa9 2019 All rights reserved. e.Republic', b'Net Neutrality Loss Could Rekindle ISP Alternatives for Internet Access - Scientific American\nSkip to main contentSubscribeMenuScientific American Cart 0Sign In Email *:Password *:Forgot password?LoginNot yet registered?|Stay InformedSearchSubscribeCloseSearchCloseAdvanced SearchThe SciencesMindHealth TechSustainabilityEducationVideoPodcastsBlogsPublicationsSubscribeCurrent IssueCart0Sign InStay InformedShareLatestComputingNet Neutrality Loss Could Rekindle ISP Alternatives for Internet AccessThe FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to kill the 2015 Open Internet Order hands more control to large broadband providers, but internet users have other options for getting onlineBy Larry Greenemeier on January 8, 2018Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditShare on LinkedInShare viaPrintNYC Mesh\xe2\x80\x99s community-owned and managed broadband network in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn is set to grow dramatically following the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s recent vote against regulating commercial ISPs. Credit: mromerorta PixabayAdvertisement\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note (06/11/18):\xc2\xa0Scientific American\xc2\xa0is re-posting the following article, originally published January 8, 2018, now that the Federal Communications Commission\xe2\x80\x99s repeal of net neutrality rules has gone into effect. Many fear the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s December decision to\xc2\xa0kill the Open Internet Order\xc2\xa0could embolden broadband providers to manipulate how their customers access and use the internet, although it remains to be seen whether that will happen.\nThe Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision to kill the Open Internet Order has a lot of net neutrality advocates fearing the worst. Foremost among those concerns: that last month\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Communications Commission vote might embolden broadband providers to manipulate how their customers access and use the internet. Although it remains to be seen whether that will happen, a small but growing number of users are taking matters into their own hands by exploring community- or municipal-owned, operated and funded internet access as a cheaper, faster and more neutral alternative to using large commercial internet service providers.\nNYC Mesh, which typically gets 20 requests per month for membership to its community-based network in New York City, has received connection inquiries from more than 200 people since the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s December 14 vote, says Brian Hall, a software consultant who helps manage the network. Self-organized, community-run systems including this one and Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s The Equitable Internet Initiative have for years offered alternatives to corporate ISPs such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.\nThe community approach typically involves organizers renting internet access from a local data center, and installing rooftop antennas and wi-fi routers that together act as access point for nearby residents. Unlike a home or office router that provides wi-fi service for a dozen or so square meters, a community network can provide a wi-fi signal for several square kilometers. Residents connect to the access point by mounting their own antennas on their buildings\xe2\x80\x99 rooftops or outside their windows. These antennas receive the network\xe2\x80\x99s signal and send it through a cable to wi-fi routers located inside members\xe2\x80\x99 homes or offices. The setup is called a \xe2\x80\x9cmesh\xe2\x80\x9d network because any member can act as an access point, or node, for other members.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are so used to ISPs that they think that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to access the internet,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall says, adding ISPs have built their businesses by acting as gatekeepers between customers and the internet in order to extract as much money as possible. NYC Mesh pays about $1,000 per month to use the data center but does not charge members for access to the mesh network. The organization currently uses a grant from the Internet Society New York Chapter to pay the rent, and suggests members donate $20 per month to help cover ongoing rental and management costs.\nNYC Mesh has 70 wi-fi router nodes, many of which are connected to two "supernodes" that provide internet access at about 100 megabits per second, or Mbps\xe2\x80\x94more than twice as fast as the average commercial ISP connection\xe2\x80\x94throughout Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. The original supernode is run out of a Lower Manhattan data center. In that setup the group\xe2\x80\x99s antenna is mounted on the roof and their computer servers are a few floors below in what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cradio room,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall says. The servers run software that manages the network. They are also linked via optical fiber cables to a \xe2\x80\x9cmeet-me room\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the location in a data center where networks interconnect directly with the internet backbone, without needing an ISP to serve as an intermediary.\nTo access one of the supernodes, a resident needs to get a wi-fi router node and install an antenna\xe2\x80\x94either on the roof of their building or in a window with an unobstructed line of sight to the supernode\xe2\x80\x99s transmitting antennas. Members whose view of the antennas is blocked by a building or bridge can connect to other NYC Mesh members\xe2\x80\x99 nodes. Residents can also access the network using the public LinkNYC kiosks that the city has installed throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re basically a wi-fi network,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall says.\nHall and others involved in NYC Mesh have recently been meeting to figure out how they can scale up the network to meet rising demand. One option is renting more antennas at supernode sites, and installing more large antennas atop tall buildings spread throughout the city and surrounding area. He estimates it would take between 20 and 50 supernodes to cover the city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs.\nHours after the FCC vote Motherboard\xe2\x80\x94an online magazine that Vice Media launched in 2009\xe2\x80\x94announced plans to set up and operate its own community mesh network in Brooklyn, and to publish a how-to guide for others interested in doing the same thing in their own areas. The project is still in the early planning stages. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of nonprofits and community groups and even just meet-up groups made of private citizens have built networks like this across the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Motherboard Editor in Chief Jason Koebler says. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time we write about one of these community groups, people ask, \xe2\x80\x98What are the actual logistics of making something like this happen?\xe2\x80\x99 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good answer for them often, so we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d start from scratch.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPublic Broadband\nAnother approach, called municipal broadband or public broadband, offers residents internet access via a network supported by their city or town government\xe2\x80\x94often with outside help from tech companies or public utilities. This allows local governments to provide the service at low prices\xe2\x80\x94or for free. Starting in 2010 Google\xe2\x80\x99s Fiber division began offering broadband service directly to consumers. Within a few years the company was delivering high-quality internet access to nine U.S. locations\xe2\x80\x94including Kansas City, Austin and Atlanta. Unfortunately, a reorganization at Alphabet (Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company) prompted the company to announce in October 2016 it would not extend its Fiber services beyond those locations it already served, plus three locations where fiber installation was already in progress and completed in 2017.*\nThe thinking behind publicly owned networks is that municipal governments have greater incentive than privately owned ISPs (which have little competition) to provide citizens, government agencies and local businesses with free or affordable high-speed internet access. Large ISPs, in an attempt to keep competition at bay, have lobbied hard\xe2\x80\x94and with some success\xe2\x80\x94to block or limit municipalities from offering broadband services. Several states, including Tennessee and Colorado, now have laws banning municipally run networks. Despite those restrictions, the city council in Fort Collins, Colo., voted on January 2 to move ahead with plans to build a public broadband network. In November an additional 19 cities and counties throughout the state approved financing to study the feasibility of their own municipal broadband projects.\nThe FCC\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to enforce net neutrality will \xe2\x80\x9ccatalyze\xe2\x80\x9d more city hall conversations about the best way to deliver broadband to both citizens and businesses, says Lev Gonick, Arizona State University\xe2\x80\x99s chief information officer and former CEO of the nonprofit broadband service provider OneCommunity. \xe2\x80\x9cAt a minimum, [municipal broadband] efforts put incumbent providers on notice that a city is looking for a competitive marketplace,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonick says.\nMunicipalities can fund the set up and management of public internet service in a few ways, such as issuing bonds or collaborating with local broadband providers. Publicly owned broadband networks have a mixed track record, however. Some municipal networks are owned by public utilities, such as Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Cedar Falls Utilities or the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, Tenn. These fiber networks deliver citywide gigabit-per-second speeds (a gigabit is one billion bits) that far surpass even the best ISP service in the U.S. The country\xe2\x80\x99s largest commercial ISPs offer average fixed (as opposed to mobile) broadband download speeds of about 64 Mbps whereas the average upload speed is under 23 Mbps, according to a report published last year by internet speed test company Ookla. (The FCC has for the past several years defined broadband as connection speeds of at least 25 Mbps for downloads and three Mbps for uploads.) There are, however, also many examples of failed municipal broadband projects, including iProvo in Utah and the City of Monticello in Minnesota. Mismanagement and high costs doomed both projects.\nWhether community- or municipal-run networks can handle a potential influx of tens of millions of disenchanted ISP subscribers is an open question. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate at this time to say that we have the solution to the problem that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision has handed us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nathan Schneider, a media studies scholar in residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. Still, these localized options are important at the very least for the pressure they put on ISPs to deliver good service at a reasonable price, Schneider says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fundamental problem with the situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now is that [many] broadband providers are monopolies, but are not being recognized as such by the government,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do away with the principle of [net neutrality], on whose terms do we want to do that\xe2\x80\x94a big corporation or a company owned and operated by its customers?\xe2\x80\x9d\n*Correction (01/12/18): This paragraph was edited after posting.

Her departure is part of a reshuffling of the de Blasio administration that has been taking place over the past six months and includes the exit of two deputy mayors.\nIn an interview Tuesday, Roest, 58, said she had always planned to retire after serving one term, but had nonetheless delayed taking the step.\n"I have honestly been struggling with the decision," she said. "Everybody in City Hall knows I am loving my job."\nWhat tipped the balance was the strain of traveling to Vermont, where her partner lives. Roest will soon move there to live with him.\nWhen Roest started her tenure at DoITT, the agency was struggling to complete a modernization of its 911 system that was plagued with cost overruns and delays. She turned the project around by cutting ties with the outside consultants overseeing it and bringing the work in-house.\n"The city workforce put it back on schedule and on budget," she told Crain\'s. "It was in-sourcing on a grand scale."\nShe said she was also proud of making the agency more customer-centric\xe2\x80\x94the customers being the more than 100 city agencies that rely on the department for phone, internet and data services. Another high point was the conversion of pay phones into the LinkNYC Wi-Fi hubs, a project "born out of the brains" of the agency\'s franchise unit, she said.\nThe next commissioner will have to deal with one significant, unresolved issue of Roest\'s tenure: the city\'s effort to make Verizon\'s FiOS service available to every residence in the five boroughs.\n"It is frustrating that that promise was broken and we needed to sue," Roest said. Verizon says it has lived up to the terms of its franchise agreement.\nRoest said she does not know what she will do next.\n"I\'ve talked about everything from growing organic carrots to getting involved in local politics," she said. "I\'ll need to do something, but I need to get closer to home."\nIn a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, "I want to thank Anne for her years of service and her tireless efforts to manage, maintain and streamline city technology and keep our data secure."\nRelated Articles\nBrooklyn lawmaker charged with fraud, obstruction of justice\nBiz leaders: Let nonunion contractors do subway projects\nVeteran congresswoman\'s challenger fills campaign coffers\nNonprofit in fraud case got nearly $200K from Brooklyn pol\nNYC sues, divests from oil firms over climate change\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain\'s New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain\'s Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

The city swore in a new mayor at the beginning of the year, an event which often prompts CIO departures. Though there is no exact date set for Roest to leave, Saini will start at DOITT at the end of January and Roest will stay on for a few weeks to help with the transition.\nBoth Saini and Roest received Top 25 awards from Government Technology in 2017.\nRELATEDAnne RoestAtlanta\xe2\x80\x99s Internal Platform Turns Public to Provide Real-Time Commuter Data Following Bridge CollapseNecessity Dictates One Rapidly Growing Jurisdiction\'s Smart City TransformationIn an email, Roest said the timing of the decision is personal \xe2\x80\x94 she\'s retiring so that she can move with her partner to Vermont, where she wants to spend more time at a home she purchased years ago.\n"It was a hard decision," Roest wrote.\nShe might not stay away from all work \xe2\x80\x94 she\'s "exploring opportunities" \xe2\x80\x94 but there\'s no job lined up for her.\nSaini started his government career in 2010 after beginning in the private sector, and quickly made a name for himself building out fiber connectivity and embracing data analytics. During his time in the city\xe2\x80\x99s IT office, Saini led efforts to gather more valuable traffic data in order to deal with mounting congestion problems, launched a smart city corridor, moved systems to the cloud and helped connect low-income housing residents to the Internet.\nRoest came to New York City in 2014 after more than 25 years working for New York state in various capacities, including public safety CIO.\nWhile managing the largest municipal IT office in the country, DOITT took on some ambitious work. It was under Roest that the city rolled out its fleet of more than 1,000 LinkNYC Internet-connected kiosks, with plans to eventually install 7,500. The department helped launch a city-specific Census data map, then it helped launch a new open data portal. She has also helped set up the first citywide Cyber Command center.\nPerhaps the largest single effort Saini will take on as he starts the new role is an effort to fully digitize the city\'s 911 system. The new system should be able to accept texts, photos, videos and social media as well as phone calls.\nRoest said some of the highlights of her career were the installation of the first LinkNYC kiosk and the opening of a 911 center in the Bronx, which she described as "an impossible project with an impossible timeline that an amazing interagency team delivered."\n"The best moments have been seeing the pride and ownership of the government works," she wrote. "I believe in the workforce, the mission, and the people in government who have never let me down. They work hard and smart and deliver."\nAs she leaves, Roest is urging government IT leaders not to let themselves fall behind on broader technological changes.\n"The most important thing in government IT right now is to learn how to change with the changing technology landscape," she wrote. "As the rate of change increases, it becomes harder for government to stay ahead. We have to keep our eye on the ball and embrace change as an enabler of great business solutions."\nIn a written statement, Saini said he\'s excited to start his new job and thanked Roest for building the team he\'ll be leading.\n"I look forward to building on the progress already made at DOITT to further strengthen and ensure the reliability and security of NYC systems and infrastructure," Saini wrote. "I\xe2\x80\x99m also thrilled about the opportunity to partner with New York City agencies to advance the use of innovative technologies that can improve quality of life for all New Yorkers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a simultaneous announcement, the city revealed that it has named Debbie Rosen chief of staff to First Deputy Mayor Dean Fuleihan. Per a mayoral executive order, the first deputy mayor oversees New York City Cyber Command.\nBen Miller\nAssociate Editor of GT Data and Business\nBen Miller is the associate editor of data and business for\xc2\xa0Government Technology.

De Blasio commended Roest for her leadership at the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), highlighting her efforts to improve emergency communications and cybersecurity.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to thank Anne for her years of service and her tireless efforts to manage, maintain and streamline city technology and keep our data secure,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said.\nRoest played an integral part in the city\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Communications Transformation Program, in\xc2\xa0which city IT\xc2\xa0partnered with police and fire departments to construct a state-of-the-art 911 dispatch and communications center and\xc2\xa0streamlined\xc2\xa0emergency communication systems across the city. The effort had been mired in delays and cost overruns before DoITT took over management of the dispatch centers in 2014. Roest formulated a plan and in May 2017, the $900 million, 550,000 square-foot facility opened its doors.\nRoest\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0contributions also included assisting with the\xc2\xa0hire of the city\xe2\x80\x99s first citywide information security officer and the launch of LinkNYC, a public-private partnership that is bringing the city\xc2\xa0free municipal Wi-Fi through a network of kiosks.\nPrior to joining the city in 2014, Roest served\xc2\xa0as the public safety chief information officer for New York state\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Information Technology Services, from 2012 to 2014. Before this, she was the state\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0deputy\xc2\xa0commissioner for IT\xc2\xa0at\xc2\xa0Criminal Justice Services, between 2005 and 2012, and the IT\xc2\xa0director at the state\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Taxation and Finance, from\xc2\xa01986 to 2005, according to LinkedIn.\nDe Blasio said that Saini, with his leadership of IT infrastructure and smart city projects in Atlanta,\xc2\xa0will build upon Roest\xe2\x80\x99s work.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m confident Samir Saini\xe2\x80\x99s impressive work in Atlanta makes him well-equipped to take on the crucial work of this agency, including continuing the modernization of our 911 system \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0which touches the lives of all New Yorkers,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said.\nAs CIO of Atlanta Saini implemented a text-to-911 system, and also\xc2\xa0helped launch the city\xe2\x80\x99s Atlanta Smart Corridor to test Internet of Things solutions, autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies. Saini also drove many civic tech projects, like the city\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with Waze to alert drivers of traffic delays during the Interstate 85 fire and bridge collapse in 2017.\nIn an email to StateScoop, Saini expressed enthusiasm to take on the new role, thanking Roest for her dedication to DoITT and de Blasio for the opportunity to lead the department.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to building on the progress already made at DoITT to further strengthen and ensure the reliability and security of NYC systems and infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d Saini said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m also thrilled about the opportunity to partner with New York City agencies to advance the use of innovative technologies that can improve quality of life for all New Yorkers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs described by the city,\xc2\xa0Saini \xe2\x80\x98s role\xc2\xa0will be a\xc2\xa0balance between innovation and support for the city\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0IT\xc2\xa0infrastructure.\nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s statement reads:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be responsible for maintaining the foundational\xc2\xa0IT infrastructure and systems that touch every aspect of city life \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0from public safety to human services, education and economic development \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0crossing the full spectrum of governmental operations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n-In this Story-\nAnne Roest, Careers & Elected Officials, Chief Information Officer (CIO), CIO appointment, Civic Tech, Cybersecurity, IT Infrastructure, Modernization, New York City, retirement, Samir Saini, Smart Cities, State & Local News, Tech News\nRelated news\nCity\nLos Angeles city controller updates online property map to boost housing, economy\nby Colin Wood \xe2\x80\xa2 2 hours ago\nCity\n'Bootcamp' program aims to boost New York City's cybersecurity workforce\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 6 hours ago\nCity\nDetroit kicks off Ford-backed transportation challenge\nby Ryan Johnston \xe2\x80\xa2 6 hours ago\nAd Specs\nSponsor\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Scoop News Group\n|\nAll Rights Reserved\nSearch for:\nThe latest state and local government tech news, delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

Hunger is a huge issue in NYC. 15% of NYC\xe2\x80\x99s 8.5 million population is hungry. Research shows that there is a decline in the number of New Yorker volunteers over a decade.The Food Bank of New York City is a charitable foundation striving to stop hunger. It needs volunteers to sustain the operation. The goal of our service is to connect volunteers accessing the opportunities easily.TeamI am pleased to team with exceptionally talented and supportive teammates.Arielle, JasonSponsorsLinkNYC, Foodbanks for NYCAdvising ProfessorMarshall SittenInitial AssumptionInitially, we presumed that food bank is in need of more food. So we started our research towards that.Field Research:In reality, they have ample food.Stakeholder research:We discussed with Chris, volunteer engagement associate of FBNYC. He told that they get more food but not more volunteers. Hence we shifted our gear more towards the volunteer experience.Problem:\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we inspire New Yorkers to engage in volunteer initiatives for the Food Bank of NYC\xc2\xa0?\xe2\x80\x9dWe decided to analyze the existing system of getting volunteering.Analyze Existing\xc2\xa0Service:Initially we analyzed the experience today,There are three things involved in this serviceSignup and registration processDoing the servicePost serviceThe tedious signup process leads 75% of the volunteers to drop the service. The CTA for registration is loaded with more amount of content. The navigation through several pages and more filtering options to find the best service is time-consuming.Signup and registration processOur survey results from the users list three things that people consider before volunteering.Whether1) It suits their schedule;2) Location is convenient;3) Evident and tangible impacts.As per research options presented on the website are not filling the needs of the user.2. Doing the serviceSince the management network is engaged in serving the food, they cannot endure and instruct the new volunteers.3. Post Service:The team cannot manage to acquire perceptions after every service instead it sends inappropriate mail.The main hindrances of Foodbank are listed.1. Profused sign-up process.2. Inept organization of on-site experience.3. No honors to the volunteers after the service.Week Signals\xc2\xa0found:When we worked towards resolving the tedious sign-up process, we noticed the weak central signal.Target Audience:An ad about the service would incline more bustling New Yorkers who have a giving heart and cares about the community towards volunteering.We produce two main things from our survey research: 1) people want volunteering to be convenient to their schedule; 2) people want to observe the results of their efforts.Our approaches to tackle the challenges:Initial Idea:For driving towards the solution, we captured all the weak signals and transformed into opportunities.With the idea of doing a public ad, we roamed around the city and obtained all the ad platforms. We decided to display the ads in\xc2\xa01. Bus stops,2. Phone booths,\xc2\xa03. Subways and\xc2\xa04. LinkNYC.Why LinkNYCThe primary reason for picking LINK NYC is it delivers content dynamically based on the location of the city.\xc2\xa0The four main reasons behind our selection:1. Since Kiosks are all over the city (1200), we can reach a significant number of users to acquire an accurate and fruitful outcome.2. LinkNYC is upheld by a prominent team of developers and data scientists. Hence we can measure the qualitative aspects of the data.\xc2\xa0An example of the former result analysis is attached.3. Link NYC is embedded with an internet-enabled tablet.\xc2\xa04. In future, we can utilize it for volunteer signup process.New Service\xc2\xa0Idea:Our initial service aims to incorporate easy-to-use technology, like QR codes and SMS so that New Yorkers can quickly engage with Food Bank collateral.Once they wish to engage with the service, they will be directly taken to the registration page and optimized for mobile.\xc2\xa01. Our version will filter only the nearby locations.2. We aim to intensify the onsite volunteer on-boarding process.3. After volunteering, our service will remind the impact through email..BluePrintThe line of interaction or elements that exist behind the scenes are outlined.Touch PointsLink Kiosk: SMS or QR codes to link new users.Mobile: Once a display is scanned, a New Yorker will be taken to the registration site.Email: A New Yorker will receive a confirmation email once signing up and a thank you email after the service with statistics.Food Bank NYC: The volunteer must be on-boarded and routed to the area to be serviced.Web: There is a robust web experience where users can investigate and sign up for the service.From: A guide to service blueprinting by Adaptive\xc2\xa0PathThe service proposal is a partnership between FB NYC and LINKNYC.FB NYC will be supplying all the API data to Link, which will host digital advertisements and Geo-targeted ads which ensure that pedestrians are perceiving opportunities close to them.Interested pedestrians can text the number on the ad or capture the QR code to go to a mobile optimized site for a quick sign up process. The users are invited with a confirmation email and a thank you email after their service.First PrototypeManifests the convenience.Ads display the closeness to volunteer opportunities.2.

Click here to learn more.\n2 Comments\nJanuary 10, 2018 at 1:52 pm\nnews\nCivic Tech: The City of Toronto must remain a public platform\nSidewalk Labs' ideas for Quayside are not intended to stay in Quayside.\nBy\nBianca Wylie\nPhoto courtesy of Sidewalk Labs.\nHeading into a year of public consultations on Sidewalk Labs in Toronto, Civic Tech brings you this first piece in a series that will explore a range of issues raised by residents concerned about the project.\nFor background, see this piece, and consider adding your questions to the ongoing community question document.\nIf you have an idea for this series or would like to contribute, please contact our editor.\nOur city cannot become a privatized digital platform\nIn the tech world, the word \xe2\x80\x9cplatform\xe2\x80\x9d is used to describe an interconnected set of products and services. Sidewalk Labs has not been shy about using the word to describe the way it sees cities.\nDan Doctoroff, chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, has likened the city to the operating system of a mobile phone, saying: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made [the smartphone] ultimately magical is that it enabled millions of people around the world to use their imagination and skills to create apps that, in most cases, no one ever dreamed the platform would be used for and keep it fresh, changing, useful, and current.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo keep with the analogy, Sidewalk Labs should never be our operating system. That\xe2\x80\x99s the role of government. If Sidewalk Labs wants to build some apps, they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do so. But these apps will need oversight, especially since they may seek to disrupt the delivery of public services.\nThe great and dangerous advantage of the technology sector is that it can go straight to market and its consumers via the internet. That can make tech products seem inevitable, instead of conditional on appropriate regulation. (Think of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s operating strategy.) As we move into a consultation on Sidewalk Labs, which will likely include some pilot projects, we must remember this: although consultation is a step in the right direction, it is not a substitute for policy or law. It\xe2\x80\x99s an input to both.\nBeware the blurring line between private and public sector language\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s Rohit Aggarwala, head of urban systems at Sidewalk Labs, quoted in a piece in Smithsonianmag.com about the project. It\xe2\x80\x99s an example of a communications strategy that makes Sidewalk Labs sound like the government, an issue that goes persistently unchecked in the press:\nAggarwala also offers assurances that the purpose of gathering so much data is not a commercial one. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t about trying to figure out how we make money from capturing all this information for advertisers. That\xe2\x80\x99s not our objective,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cOur objective is to build a great neighbourhood. The only reason we want to capture information is to provide better urban services.\nDan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, doubled down on this line today in his\xc2\xa0Sidewalk Labs Reddit AMA. Of course the data collection is for commercial purposes \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0it may not be for advertising, but for the provision of for-profit urban services. Sidewalk Labs is not the government, nor is it a philanthropic arm of Alphabet. It\xe2\x80\x99s a business. And its sister company, Google, recently received a\xc2\xa0$2.7-billion (U.S.) fine from the European Commission for anti-trust behaviour. (Google is appealing the decision.)\nAs you watch Sidewalk Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s communications, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see constant references to leading urban thinkers and theories. This is intended to instill trust and familiarity among the urbanites who are closely monitoring the project, and highlight the city-building aspect of the project while downplaying the tech-business side.\nAlphabet, the parent company of Sidewalk Labs, has a market capitalization of approximately $730 billion (U.S.). That is roughly half of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s GDP. For all the times Sidewalk Toronto references Jane Jacobs, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget this.\nDecision-making on data: Who\xe2\x80\x99s in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat?\nSidewalk Labs has said that it will make some of the data from this project available. The problem is that this is not, and never has been, Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 decision to make.\nThere are three core outstanding questions to answer about the data from this and any other smart city project in Canada:\nWho can collect it?\nWho can use it?\nAnd under what terms?\nThere is a strong argument to be made that there is only one organization that can collect civic data, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s data from sensors monitoring the environment or from people moving in a public space\xe2\x80\x94the government.\nMita Williams, a librarian at the University of Windsor with a long-time interest in open data, put it this way in a recent tweet: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are forced to trade our personal data when we use services such as Facebook. But our cities cannot be treated as the same. Civic data should belong to the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom there, in terms of ownership, the list can expand beyond government. Individuals could also own it. Who can use it? Lots of people. It\xe2\x80\x99s here, at this stage, that we get into open data. Global corporations and small businesses alike can use it if, and only if, we all agree it should be open data in the first place.\nHaving public data collection and access to core information about our cities is a modern-day census, not one we should privatize in any circumstance. Teresa Scassa, Canada research chair in information law and policy at the University of Ottawa outlines some of the related issues in this recent piece on data ownership.\nCivic data provides critical information to government and residents, to researchers and non-profits and academics and the private sector. So yes, some of it should definitely be open, but determining these details is a task for the government, not Sidewalk Labs.\nSidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable ambition and the network effect\nAnother reason it\xe2\x80\x99s important to maintain government ownership and control over any platform in our city is a phenomenon known as a \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork effect.\xe2\x80\x9d A company\xe2\x80\x99s products become more powerful as the number of people using them grows.\nConsider Facebook: you use it because everyone else is using it.\nNetwork effects can lead to market domination and monopolies because of the power inherent from having many people use and rely on your product. And once a platform is embedded in society as a social norm, it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly difficult to dislodge.\nSidewalk Labs has said that their appetite to move beyond the Quayside testing ground and into the rest of the city is \xe2\x80\x9cinsatiable.\xe2\x80\x9d Their model includes a suite of proprietary products that would use a digital platform. See: Waymo (autonomous vehicles), Flow (transportation planning), Waze (traffic data), Cityblock (social-service delivery), LinkNYC (public Wi-Fi), and Nest (thermostats, outdoor security cameras).\nWill Fleissig, chief executive of Waterfront Toronto, has said that \xe2\x80\x9cSidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s proposal stood out from more than a half-dozen submissions by demonstrating a plan that can take high-level conceptual ideas, piloting them and scaling them across a city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe ideas for Quayside are not intended to stay in Quayside. As such, Toronto must pay close attention to the core governance issues at the heart of this project. It\xe2\x80\x99s critical to ensure that what\xe2\x80\x99s public and vital to our city\xe2\x80\x99s operation stays under public control.\nThanks for reading this first instalment. Next up, Pam Sethi on health care.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on public consultation activities as we learn of them. For now, your best bet is to follow @waterfronttoronto and @sidewalktoronto on Twitter and consider signing up for both of their newsletters: \xc2\xa0Waterfront Toronto (left hand sidebar) and\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sidewalk Toronto (scroll down, subscribe bottom right).\nOn December 20, 2017, Waterfront Toronto released the summary report from its first town hall meeting. We at Torontoist were happy to see the community list of questions included, as well as answers to several of them. As the process unfolds, we\xe2\x80\x99ll update the document with official answers. In addition, Patrick Connolly of Civic Tech Toronto has created a spreadsheet of press resources from the listing in the report.\nThe way this project plays out in the press matters. Technology has its own press. Urban planning has its own press. And business has its own press. Rarely does one publication or sub-section of a publication touch on all three specifics, so it can be difficult to assess the project through these three lenses simultaneously. Throughout this series, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working to expand on some of the tech, business, and urban planning aspects as they relate to the project and its governance and politics.\nFiled under civic tech, network effect, Open Data, platforms, Quayside, sidewalk, Sidewalk Labs\nShare\n\xef\x82\x9a\n\xef\x82\x99\n\xef\x83\x95\n\xef\x83\x92\n\xef\x83\xa0\nReport error \xc2\xb7\nSend a tip\nComments\nSocial Media\nFollow @torontoist\nAbout Us\n\xc2\xa9 2019, Buzz Connected Media Inc.

(Photo courtesy SidewalkToronto.ca)\nWhen Sidewalk Labs hosted a public forum in Toronto last November to gather feedback on its plan to build a data-driven innovation hub on a mostly derelict stretch of industrial waterfront, several participants posed tough questions about how the company, a subsidiary of Alphabet/Google, would address privacy issues\xe2\x80\x94questions that have yet to be answered some three months later.Sidewalk Labs (a Civic Hall member organization) was founded by former Bloomberg CEO and New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff. The company launched its pitch in mid-October amidst an international media blitz that included promotional appearances by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and former Google chairman Eric Schmidt. In particular, Sidewalk proposed to develop a green, affordable, and innovation-driven mixed-use waterfront community to be built using emerging data, mapping, and network technologies, such as the deployment of public data-gathering sensors and automated shuttle buses that would serve the area instead of private vehicles. Sidewalk also pledged to invest US$50 million in pilot projects in Toronto as they negotiate a final development agreement with local agencies over the coming year.The central premise of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s plan, now being evaluated by Waterfront Toronto, is to leverage data gathered in the public realm to achieve goals such as improving traffic flow, enabling autonomous vehicle movement, and reducing emissions on a 12-acre brownfields site known as Quayside that could become home to Google Canada\xe2\x80\x99s new headquarters, a cluster of tech companies, and other mixed-use buildings. Sidewalk and WT both talked initially about expanding the plan to a mostly fallow 800-acre swath of industrial Port Lands east of Quayside, but City of Toronto officials poured cold water on that goal in December.From the beginning, SWL has cast its plan as a kind of urban digital platform that will encourage third-party tech firms to \xe2\x80\x9cdesign city improvements\xe2\x80\x9d using data gathered from users of this new community\xe2\x80\x94a model not unlike the way Apple and Facebook encourage developers to create applications for their respective platforms.Sidewalk is no stranger to data and privacy issues. Their first venture\xe2\x80\x94through a company SWL has invested in (and shares New York office space with) called Intersection\xe2\x80\x94was turning hundreds of former payphone connection points in New York into free wifi-enabled LinkNYC wayfinding kiosks, with revenues generated by advertising. In late 2016, LinkNYC had to disable the web browsers following reports that they were being used to download porn.But concerns remain about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s data gathering practices. According to this analysis by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy initially allowed them to retain significant user data and browsing histories. While they tightened up the privacy policies in 2017, EFF still has concerns about data breaches and the lack of public input into the governance of these kiosks, which will soon be outfitted with cameras and other sensors. As EFF\xe2\x80\x99s post noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no means for New Yorkers to participate in decisions about how data from Link kiosks will be used, with whom it will be shared, for how long it will be retained, or whether the parameters under which it is initially collected might conceivably expand in the future.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile the initial Toronto pitch included a data privacy pledge that included hiring Ann Cavoukian, a former high-ranking Ontario government privacy official, to advise SWL on its practices, attendees at the forum nonetheless wanted to know more about safeguards and the company\xe2\x80\x99s accountability and transparency plans for its data-gathering operations.Indeed, as SWL itself has acknowledged, a good deal of the media coverage so far has focused on issues relating to privacy, intellectual property and the ultimate ownership of data gathered from the movement of people through the public spaces on the land it aims to develop. Some of the commentary, including a widely-read report in The Guardian, raised pointed concerns about what it described as \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle Urbanism.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile SWL\xe2\x80\x99s plan is geared at Toronto, the data governance issues resonate widely. The firm\xe2\x80\x99s pitch in Toronto could set precedents for how governments and public agencies elsewhere regulate these emerging technologies, including the troves of data they both consume and produce.Increasingly, as CityLab recently reported, some public agencies are raising questions about the ownership of the data of private mobility firms\xe2\x80\x94ridesharing companies in particular\xe2\x80\x94whose operations have triggered growing congestion and decreased transit usage in some jurisdictions.But several months into what was expected to be a swift year-long process to negotiate a formal development agreement, neither SWL, Waterfront Toronto, nor the company\xe2\x80\x99s privacy advisor have much to offer in the way of specifics about how they plan to deal with these data governance issues.Quayside (Photo courtesy Waterfront Toronto)In an email response, WT chief executive Will Fleissig said that the ultimate agreement \xe2\x80\x9cwill include provisions\xc2\xa0to ensure and enforce requirements regarding privacy considerations, as well as other critical issues relating to data governance and ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d Other government agencies, he added, may be involved. But Fleissig declined to say whether Cavoukian, as SWL\xe2\x80\x99s paid privacy advisor, will be required to report her findings or recommendations to Waterfront Toronto.Cavoukian, in an interview in late December, said she would be \xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d to report her eventual findings and recommendations to Waterfront Toronto, but the prospect hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arisen in the handful of meetings she has had so far.Nor has either body released the details, mandate, or membership of a pledge to establish a privacy advisory board, except to say that it will include government officials, academics, and community members. Asked if the group would meet in public and disclose its reports, Micah Lasher, a former Bloomberg administration political staffer who co-founded the lobbying powerhouse SDK Knickerbocker and now serves as Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson, replied by email: \xe2\x80\x9cWe aim to make the process as transparent as possible. The Board is still in formation and its structure and protocols yet to be determined.\xe2\x80\x9dSuch hedges explain why some observers have questioned Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s public positioning. Writing in Torontoist last fall, open data activist and writer Bianca Wylie posed a series of hard-hitting questions for Sidewalk about issues such as the ownership of intellectual property developed on the project, public access to the data collected, security issues, and the intended beneficiaries. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is the user that Sidewalks Labs is ultimately serving?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCompanies that want to learn about how people interact with physical spaces? Real estate investors? Cities?\xe2\x80\x9dCavoukian\xe2\x80\x99s role, in particular, has drawn attention from Wylie and other critics who worry that her presence is more about public relations than oversight. She served for many years as the Ontario government\xe2\x80\x99s Information and Privacy Commissioner, a public official who administers the province\xe2\x80\x99s privacy laws, reports to the Ontario legislature, and is independent of the government of the day.Since her retirement, Cavoukian has held a position at Ryerson University, where she heads a \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy by design\xe2\x80\x9d think tank. Initially, SWL didn\xe2\x80\x99t publicly acknowledge that she was being paid for her advice (her unit at Ryerson provides certification services to companies and other organizations). \xe2\x80\x9cI am being paid but so what?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in an interview in late December. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no vested interest in this.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile Cavoukian will be delivering a consulting service and connecting SWL with tech firms that perform specific data-related tasks such as anonymizing large data sets, these tasks aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same as providing formal oversight.Indeed, the question of who or what will actually regulate the data-gathering envisioned by SWL remains largely unanswered.As the head of the IPCO, Cavoukian had legal authority to investigate government or other public agencies and was insulated from interference.She admits her current position with SWL has no such structural protections. She contends that as the former commissioner, her imprimatur not only carries weight but also puts pressure on SWL to own up to its promises. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing comparable to the IPCO [mandate].\xe2\x80\x9d Cavoukian also concedes that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way she could determine whether she was being given complete access to SWL\xe2\x80\x99s data systems in order to determine whether the company is living up to its public commitment to transparency. \xe2\x80\x9cHow would anyone prove that?\xe2\x80\x9dYet she says the eventual privacy advisory board that is established to oversee this venture should conduct its business in public. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that would make sense. I would imagine that those things should be made public.\xe2\x80\x9dAsked if SWL would agree to allow Waterfront Toronto or city officials to seek an independent evaluation of Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s proposed privacy policies, Lasher didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer a definitive answer: \xe2\x80\x9cWe would review any such proposal and react to its specifics, but we certainly aim to establish mechanisms that give Torontonians and their representatives in government confidence and clarity when it comes to all the work that happens as part of Sidewalk Toronto.\xe2\x80\x9dThis article has been updated to clarify the relationship between Sidewalk Labs and LinkNYC, and to include the fact that Sidewalk Labs is a member of Civic Hall.\nBy: John Lorinc\nJan 10, 2018\nShare\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nShare by Email\nTopics\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Internet of ThingsSmart CitiesTransparency\nSponsors\nCraig Newmark Philanthropies\nMicrosoft\nLuminate\nGoogle\nSee all Sponsors, Partners, and Organizational\nMembers\nCivic Hall\n118 W22ND STREET, 12FL NEW YORK, NY 10011\nHours: Mon to Fri, 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.\ninfo@civichall.org\n@CivicHall on Twitter\nWhy privacy matters, Facebook's new currency, KidTube; and much more on the #FirstPost, a digest of news and analys\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/R4wqLyRXHU\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nRT @EngineerEmily: A Timeline of Civic Tech Tells a Data-Driven Story of the Field https://t.co/Mgsg6HSpvv @CivicHall https://t.co/S2yvyCskaU\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nRT @motaword: This month, MotaWord's content creator @marcosd attended New York Tech Meetup (powered by @CivicHall):\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/jhE4uLKjwq\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nRT @booksoncallnyc: We\xe2\x80\x99re so pleased to be @CivicHall this evening, handling book sales for @josephmenn and \xe2\x80\x9cCult of the Dead Cow: How\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/Xrdyj0bndW\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nRT @LeeTomson: Lunch and Learn with @PBProject in advance of their Forum @CivicHall on June 24! https://t.co/RDXA7sTb4M\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nRT @Shari_Davis1: Can't wait to kick off our #DemocracyBeyondElections conversation later this month with @CivicHall.\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/ofL2ULMtmR\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nCivic tech and your taxes; BreadTube vs alt-right; and so much more on the #FirstPost, a digest of news and analysi\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/dRwTCWnmvO\n\xe2\x80\xa2Follow Us\nWe had a blast as well!

Tall kiosks labeled \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x9d are replacing phone booths, offering free Wi-Fi and nationwide phone calls. The thing is, I have never seen anybody using one. What gives?A. Compared with the pay phones they often replace, LinkNYC kiosks, known as Links, get plenty of use, even if no one is standing next to them.According to CityBridge, the consortium that operates LinkNYC, over 3.2 million people have registered for the system\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi service, with 600,000 users each week. The Wi-Fi operates at gigabit speed, meaning it can be up to 100 times faster than cellular LTE networks. The range of a Link is about 150 feet in any direction.Links are a critical piece in the city\xe2\x80\x99s goal to bring broadband internet access to all New Yorkers, but the system\xe2\x80\x99s community-first approach provides other social benefits, as well.Each Link has an interactive screen, which offers everyday information you might expect, like weather, local maps, and transit updates, as well as a connection to the city\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service. Through a partnership with the software program Aunt Bertha, however, users can anonymously search for nonprofit and social services.Links also offer free phone calls anywhere in the country; the system registers around 200,000 calls each month. The number dialed most frequently? The state\xe2\x80\x99s hotline for its Electronic Benefits Transfer program, commonly known as food stamps.Since the system launched in early 2016, around 1,250 Links have been erected throughout all five boroughs. The company is aiming for a total of 7,500 Links by 2026, when its contract with the city is scheduled to expire.As the first system of its kind, LinkNYC has faced unforeseen difficulties. When the system was introduced, each Link offered an internet browser. But a slew of complaints of users camping out in front of the units and, in some cases, viewing inappropriate content, caused the system to remove that functionality.The system\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge is finding new locations, said Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC. The system is building a new fiber-optic network, but not every pay phone site is close enough to a manhole to connect to it.Links generate revenue through advertisements, which appear on the 55-inch screens on the sides of each kiosk. These ads are interspersed with in-house content like \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and historical photos of nearby locations. LinkNYC and the city split the ad revenue equally, subject to an annual minimum.The idea is expanding to other cities: Links have begun appearing in the United Kingdom, and are set to arrive in Philadelphia this summer.The system is in a constant state of refinement, with temporary options ranging from time-sensitive to whimsical. Through Jan. 31, for example, users can browse and enroll in health care plans; in December, each Link offered a direct line to Santa\xe2\x80\x99s voice mail.EMAIL fyi@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on , on Page MB3 of the New York edition.

Courtesy, city of Tukwila\nCity works to remove barriers to internet access\nRecently launched pilot program provides free Wi-Fi around South 144th Street.\nby Heidi JacobsTuesday, January 16, 2018 9:00amNews\nConnecting to the internet is becoming easier in Tukwila.\nOn Jan. 1, the city launched a Wi-Fi pilot that provides free internet access to anyone in the area of South 144th Street between Tukwila International Boulevard and Military Road South.\nTukwila Mayor Allan Ekberg asked Joseph Todd, the city\xe2\x80\x99s director of technology and innovation services, to find a way to provide internet access to city residents after seeing a need.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I walked the community for the mayor election, I talked to lots of residents,\xe2\x80\x9d Ekberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things I recognized was the lack of internet access for a lot of our underprivileged youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat gap in access impacts students\xe2\x80\x99 educational opportunities. The Tukwila School District has a one-to-one laptop program that provides a Chromebook for every student to take home.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose devices basically connect through the network,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hsian-Yu Kuo, the school district\xe2\x80\x99s director of information technology. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are pretty much not useful if you do not have an internet connection. Every student has one device, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve never sent them home. We can\xe2\x80\x99t send them home to students who can\xe2\x80\x99t use them, and not every student has internet access. We can\xe2\x80\x99t send them home because some student can do homework and some students can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBecause of this, the computers purchased by the district were not being used.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had stacks and stacks of them sitting in the storage room,\xe2\x80\x9d Todd said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes they would use them in class, but the idea with one-to-one is that you need to be able to take them home.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTodd began researching ways to make internet access for all students a reality and came across LinkNYC, a program that provides free Wi-Fi to millions of users in New York City.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were taking all their old phone booths and creating them into Wi-Fi hotspots,\xe2\x80\x9d Todd said.\nWith an initial investment of $16,000 from the city\xe2\x80\x99s technology and innovation services general fund, Tukwila set up nine hotspots. The hotspots are on city infrastructure utility poles along South 144th Street.\nThe school district identified the area around South 144th Street as having the highest concentration of students without internet access, many living in apartments.\nWhile the area for the pilot program is small, it serves about 600 to 700 students.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Todd said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you can go home with a Chromebook and have internet access. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be camping around Starbucks or the library to be able to get access to the internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city sent out information to residents in the area of the pilot program with instructions of how to connect to the network. Anyone who is in the area of the pilot program can access the internet for free.\nTodd hopes to monetize the internet service through advertising.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough the clicks we get the money back,\xe2\x80\x9d Todd said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take that money from the clicks and use that to expand the service.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf the program pays off, the revenue could be used to install more access points throughout the city, and it could eventually expand to all residential areas throughout the city, said Rachel Bianchi, the city\xe2\x80\x99s communications and government relations manager.\nIf service is expanded, the city\xe2\x80\x99s police and fire departments could also use the network, Todd said. Currently, public safety programs use cellular data devices to connect to the internet.\nThe city plans to monitor usage to see what sites are being visited and if students are using the connection for school.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur whole goal is to fundamentally change and improve the access for kids so they can use it for school,\xe2\x80\x9d Bianchi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to make sure \xe2\x80\x93 as we are doing this \xe2\x80\x93 it is being used in the way that we think it is being used. Like any pilot program, you are going to establish the effectiveness of how many people are using it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city is also working with Verizon to provide MiFi devices to students in other areas of the city where the Wi-Fi is not available. MiFi devices provide internet connection using cellular data.\nThe school district has selected 100 students for an after-school program where the devices will be provided.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are looking at them as having the most need, so we are going to start with that,\xe2\x80\x9d Todd said.\nKuo said Foster High School is surveying students to see how many have internet access before it begins deploying the laptops.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we want to send them home, we want to make sure students have internet access,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuo said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have students singled out because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n==\nHow to connect\nAnyone in the area of South 144th Street between Tukwila International Boulevard and Military Road South can connect to the internet through free hotspots.\nTo connect:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Go to the Wi-Fi settings on any device and join the SSID Tukwila Community WiFi.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Once connected, read and accept the terms to the user license agreement.\nFor questions or feedback, contact wifi@tukwilawa.gov.\nLearn more about the future of IT in Tukwila at futureit.tukwilawa.gov.\nThe city of Tukwila recently launched a pilot program that provides free Wi-Fi access along South 144th Street between Tukwila International Boulevard and Military Road South.

The city\'s LinkNYC internet kiosks will connect directly to the state insurance marketplace until the open enrollment period closes Jan. 31, city officials said Wednesday. A special app will connect LinkNYC users to the New York State of Health marketplace, where they can enroll in a new insurance plan or change their existing plan, officials said. The 1,200 kiosks across the five boroughs will also display public service announcements encouraging city residents to get covered if they aren\'t already. The city started installing the kiosks in 2016 to provide free wireless internet. "LinkNYC\'s superfast, free Wi-Fi is already a tremendously valuable resource for New Yorkers \xe2\x80\x94 and giving our neighbors the opportunity to get healthcare coverage right there at a Link kiosk only deepens that," Anne Roest, the outgoing commissioner of the city Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, said in a statement. The initiative is part of the city\'s efforts to connect New Yorkers with publicly funded health insurance through the state marketplace.\nIt comes after President Donald Trump reportedly cut the federal advertising budget to promote health insurance supported by the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law championed by his predecesesor, Barack Obama.\nThe city Department of Health also provides in-person counseling to help enroll people in health policies.

In my admittedly limited experience (with a less than bleeding edge tablet) it was not especially fast, nor was it reliable. I have not made use of the Wi-Fi since early in 2016, soon after the kiosks first appeared on Third Avenue in Manhattan. I do not intend to make future use of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s free Wi-Fi.\nI wanted to be a fan of LinkNYC. Really, I did. But I have come to loath these things. This loss of sympathy does not exactly compare to LBJ losing Cronkite but given my connection to the world of payphones and my personal connection to the livelihoods wiped out by the LinkNYC monopoly it is enduring enough of an issue for me that I thought I should write about it again. I did not think I would.\nMany of the LinkNYC kiosks simply Do Not Work\xe2\x84\xa2. In their uselessness they lurk ugly as hell, ingrown toenails on the city\xe2\x80\x99s streets. Countless kiosks, once erected, stand idle for months. This useless slab has inhabited its spot (COMING SOON!) since October but I have seen other LinkNYC middle fingers stand dark like this for far longer.\nInactive LinkNYC Kiosk\nCityBridge has claimed the kiosks are maintained twice a week. Maybe I do not understand what \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance\xe2\x80\x9d means but if it includes making sure the kiosks are in proper working order then I find it hard to believe these things are checked in on twice weekly. If so then they are not being maintained very well. I and others on social media have seen screens, reserved for advertisements and twee factoids, instead pouring oceans of Linux text matter 24 hours a day for weeks on end.\nAnother #LinkNYC endless bootup lightshow, this with a subtle seasonal Christmasy color splotches. pic.twitter.com/cUH1QG7ATE\n\xe2\x80\x94 Payphone Project (@payphonenews) November 28, 2017\nAnother glitch I have not noticed lately but which was showing up all over town for a couple of months was this seizure-inducing spectacle that looked like something from a discotech lightshow gone wrong. Imagine living with this right outside your living room window:\nAnother #LinkNYC psychedelic lightshow. pic.twitter.com/fjLzwdCmYX\n\xe2\x80\x94 Payphone Project (@payphonenews) October 25, 2017\nAny time I see one of these bugged out LinkNYC advertising panels all I can think is this is such an obvious thing to have not happen, and that the network must be designed so the kiosks cannot be remotely rebooted or even monitored for functionality.\nOther lasting problems with the kiosks include touchscreens that don\xe2\x80\x99t work, calls that never connect, screeching sounds inexplicably blaring from the loudspeakers, advertising screens that show no ads, etc. If you are sitting in your Hudson Yards CityBridge offices you know exactly what I am talking about.\nI could go on but enough about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s rinky-dink hardware and software. What about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s feel-good Smart City amenities and social services that are alleged to level the playing field between the rich who created these things and the poor who cannot access the Internet at anything but GIGABIT speeds?\nAt present CityBridge claims New Yorkers can register for health insurance at the New York State of Health website \xe2\x80\x9cright here\xe2\x80\x9d, meaning at a LinkNYC kiosk.\nThat is not true.\nForget about the logistics of navigating the famously recalcitrant New York State of Health website through a small tablet screen without a physical keyboard on a city sidewalk in the cold of January. Even if using the New York State of Health website was practical it would be impossible to register anew entirely from a LinkNYC kiosk. Registration requires one to create an account and validate it using an e-mail address. Assuming a LinkNYC user even has an e-mail account it would be impossible for them to access it from the kiosk. Did product planners at CityBridge imagine users would create their New York State of Health account at one device and resume their registration at a LinkNYC kiosk? Why would anyone would do that? It could be possible to use kiosks for this if you already have an account from previous years at the New York State of Health. But the registration process also requires users to upload tax returns and documents for proof of income. Has quantum computing evolved to a point where this is possible from a LinkNYC kiosk? CityBridge product management in its condescending wealth would not know having never seen anything more than their link to the New York State of Health website.\nYES, with a laptop or a tablet it should be possible to connect to the health exchange through LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi. But that is not the claim being made by CityBridge. Theirs is a cynical pronouncement few would question but which others hail as a signature achievement \xe2\x80\x94 a Smart City initiative making social services available to all. In fact it does no such thing. This digital divide remains unbridged. The only way to register for health insurance through a LinkNYC kiosk would be over the phone. That being the case you\xe2\x80\x99d have better luck using one of the old payphones these kiosks replaced. Smart City indeed.\n54\nLinkNYC: Sign up for Health Care? Not So Much.\nOne clue as to why CityBridge gets away with claiming it is possible to register for health insurance from their kiosks comes from a piece of typically soft media coverage, the likes of which LinkNYC seems amazingly capable of nurturing. The New York Times reported CityBridge \xe2\x80\x9cis working with GetCoveredNYC and the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to create a health care enrollment app on tablets across the five boroughs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo, they are \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d on an app. Seriously? With zero revenue to be made from such an app, and with time running out before the registration deadline arrives, I do not think such a product will make it to LinkNYC kiosks any time soon.\nHaving fibbed about the ability to register from a kiosk at the present time I suspect that this app CityBridge refers to Does Not Exist\xe2\x84\xa2. It is vaporware.\nThe NYC.gov website, to its credit, does not mention LinkNYC as an option for registering at the New York State of Health, probably because the city knows it cannot be done.\nBut about a week after the previous reference the Times repeated the claim that registering for health insurance is possible through the kiosks, this time in a Q & A piece that almost looks like it could have been asked and answered by CityBridge itself.\nThis little bit of public relations gawkery, catering to the self-satisfied Smart City meme that LinkNYC kiosks are designed with community-first thinking, is emblematic of the flat out lies underlining the program. One early promise of LinkNYC was that the city would be blanketed with free Wi-Fi in every road and alleyway. To fulfill that promise, and to comply with zoning requirements, residential neighborhoods would be populated with advertising-free kiosks. That pledge might have been an intentional fabrication merely meant to grease the wheels of getting CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly franchise approved but those advertising-free units will almost certainly never appear.\nSo what about the free phone calls, weather snapshots, and transit updates? I found no issues with the transit data, which come from the MTA website. The HTML forms interface is clumsy to me and the typeface is tiny, but it works.\nWeather snapshots are erratic, with reported current temperatures varying so widely from one kiosk to another that you might think climate change is a little too real. Three kiosks in a row last week showed temperatures at 40\xc2\xba, 60\xc2\xba, and 72\xc2\xba. On a very cold day in December I saw one kiosk report a balmy 49\xc2\xba. A couple of days ago, when it should have been too cold for me to care what LinkNYC thought the temperature was, this kiosk cheerily said I was out and about on a beautiful 82\xc2\xba afternoon.\nLinkNYC Weather Snapshot, Completely Wrong\nI might have never noticed it before but recently other LinkNYC kiosks have borked one feature for which I had come to think they were actually reliable: The time of day. On December 24 at about 2:30pm this kiosk claimed it was 8:04am on January 2, 2009.\nLinkNYC: The Time of Day\nWhat of the free phone calls, a marquee feature which accounts for LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s tagline as the \xe2\x80\x9cpayphone of the future\xe2\x80\x9d?\nCall quality from LinkNYC kiosks was always bad but it has actually gotten worse in recent months. This seems to be a deliberate choice of the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 maintainers. Most LinkNYC kiosks I encounter lately are set so the sound volume of the phone calls can only be turned up half way. It did not used to be like this. With any level of street noise (duh) this low-volume \xe2\x80\x9cfeature\xe2\x80\x9d makes it almost impossible to hear whoever you have called (assuming the call you made even went through). This half-way volume limitation is supposed to be LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cafter dark\xe2\x80\x9d mode, a concessionary setting begrudgingly made by CityBridge so that phone calls made at night would not disturb the sleep of people unfortunate enough to have a kiosk outside their bedroom window.\nAs of a couple of months ago I find that more and more kiosks are set to after dark mode all day long, not just at night, while others are set so that full volume on the loudspeakers can be reached 24/7. There does not seem to be a pattern or logic behind which ones are set to night mode and which ones are not.\nLast year I discovered that successfully making phone calls from these kiosks was essentially a hit-or-miss affair, with calls connecting only about half the time. That ratio seems to have improved a bit, but that might be because network availability improved after CityBridge dropped its maximum call time on some kiosks from 4 hours to 55 minutes, and it only applies to kiosks where the tablet device works in the first place. Many of the tablet screens are dark, dangling like bats-by-their-balls in \xe2\x80\x9cHang Tight\xe2\x80\x9d mode, or otherwise dysfunctional. One kiosk in my neighborhood looked like this for weeks, maybe even months. I know of other kiosk tablets that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think ever worked.\nBlinkNYC Kiosk\nI could go on with these observations but don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, though I have plenty more where this came from. These complaints might seem petty. I hear tech trolls, DoITT, and even CityBridge waking from its corporate slumber telling me to SHUT UP\xe2\x80\xa6 But given the propaganda we\xe2\x80\x99ve been fed about these things equalizing information and broadband access for all I do not understand how CityBridge, with its resources and municipal privilege, gets away with delivering such a half-assed product as LinkNYC.\nWhat to make of the fibs? Should we believe anything CityBridge says about LinkNYC? The claim that you can register for health insurance from any LinkNYC kiosk: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. What of the early claim that purely residential areas would be given advertising-free kiosks? That appears to have never been true, though this apparent canard might reflect nothing more than bad or overly-ambitious planning. Claims that each LinkNYC kiosk is maintained twice weekly seem absurd given the state of disrepair in which so many of them languish. I suspect other fabrications inhabit the LinkNYC program but will let them pass for now. The bridge rots from the bottom. If\nCityBridge can get away with all these little lies they will move on to bigger ones \xe2\x80\x94 if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t already.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never gotten past the tasteless way CityBridge addressed, or rather did not address their encampments that plagued the kiosks and turned some neighborhoods into toilets for the first 7 months of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s existence. Sycophantic press coverage suggested the company dealt with the matter swiftly but that is simply not true.\nThe poor and disenfranchised who gravitated to LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s Internet web browser (formerly on the kiosks) were nothing but pawns in an arrogant, for-profit game of Smart City brinkmanship played by tech overlords who have done nothing to prove they have any business using a city\xe2\x80\x99s streets and its people as their beta testing sandbox.\nI used to watch some of the people sitting at the kiosks, grooving to YouTube music videos, watching full length movies while the so-called \xe2\x80\x9crest of us\xe2\x80\x9d passed them by.\nThey were every bit a part of this town as the rest of us.\nThat was probably the first time a lot of those folks ever had regular access to the Internet, only to have the amenity sternly revoked with a condescending announcement that it was their fault for using the kiosks as their personal entertainment centers.\nThere could be blame to go all around but this was an inevitable result of bad planning and CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s prolonged indifference to their money-making consequences.\nSure, I could complain to 311, DoITT, or LinkNYC itself. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve found 311 to almost always be a waste of time and those other routes are futile. I had made comments to LinkNYC on Twitter but I\xe2\x80\x99ve either been ignored or asked to take it to Direct Messaging (no thanks). A Facebook posting I made regarding the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s poor phone call quality was deleted by whoever manages the LinkNYC page, an admittedly petty incident which nevertheless teed me off enough to decide I should not reach out to them anymore. There are other ways for me to waste my time.\nI could align with some of the anti-tech and anti-surveillance activists. They want me to. I\xe2\x80\x99ve considered it. I have met with them. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what value one such as I could bring to something like that. I am not an activist-minded soul to begin with but even if I was I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my voice and relatively respected reputation in the realm of public telephony would land on anything but deaf ears at DoITT or anywhere else of relevance.\nThis story will, I know, be read and summarily waved away and ignored by CityBridge and all involved. (I have access_logs!)\nThis Smart City stampede cannot be stopped, no matter its unproven track record or, in the case of LinkNYC, obvious dysfunction. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about other programs but the LinkNYC initiative in particular is simply not one of those things where the public\xe2\x80\x99s input matters. Money is being made so SHUT UP.\nMy interest in these kiosks makes sense given their connection to the world of public pay telephones. But it as a niche interest. Many New Yorkers do not know or do not care that these things exist. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care, either.\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nRelated\npreviously\xc2\xab Payphones Seen in Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cManhattan\xe2\x80\x9d\nnextPayphones of \xe2\x80\x9cCat People\xe2\x80\x9d (1982) \xc2\xbb\n2 thoughts on \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Years of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x9d\nSteven\nSeptember 14, 2018 at 12:40 pm \xc2\xb7 Edit\nAt first there were just a few, now they are on almost every street corner. I have never seen anyone using one, have you? The other day, out of curiosity, I tried to look up where to vote in primaries, but the station did not work. They are also massive eyesores. And the last thing we need is to have more screens flashing the 24/7 news cycle at us while we are walking down the street. I would think it is also extremely expensive to build and install them, and then you need people to program for them, maintenance, etc. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there much better ways to spend our NYC tax dollars?\nReply\nthe payphone project\nSeptember 14, 2018 at 12:52 pm \xc2\xb7 Edit\nI see people using them but not very often. The program is said to be 100% funded by advertising revenues, with zero tax dollars, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve long been a little suspicious of that claim being 100% true. I agree about the screens being blighted eyesores, and the quantity of these things is ludicrous. There are not even 2,000 of them on the streets yet, we are supposed to get 10,000!\nReply\nPost Comment Cancel reply\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.

Here\xe2\x80\x99s why\nNew York, home to over 8.5 million people, has roughly 1.6 million residents who lack broadband connectivity.\nImage: REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n18 Jan 2018\nRob Smith\nFormative Content\nNew Report: Are we saving enough for retirement?\nRead more\nMost Popular\nHow the digital economy is shaping a new BangladeshAzaz Zaman 19 Jun 2019\nDavid Attenborough\xe2\x80\x99s worried about this ocean threat - and it\xe2\x80\x99s not plasticEmma\nCharlton 18 Jun 2019\nGlobots and telemigrants: The new language of the future of workEshe Nelson \xc2\xb7 Quartz 19 Jun 2019\nMore on the agenda\nExplore context\nTechnological Transformation\nExplore the latest strategic trends, research and analysis\nThe United States is home to many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies including Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook.\nYet almost a quarter (23%) of urban Americans \xe2\x80\x93 nearly 62 million citizens \xe2\x80\x93 do not have access to broadband.\nThis is a similar proportion to Russia, where almost 24% of the urban population lack broadband access.\nImage: Statista\nThe chief barriers to connectivity are quality of internet and affordability. A lack of IT literacy also poses a concern.\nThat is according to a report by IHS Markit and the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA), which identified what percentage of people from urban areas in eight countries lacked access to broadband.\nThe report also analyzed connectivity in five cities, including in London where just 7%, or 625,000 of almost 8.8 million residents, are without broadband.\nIn New York, the most densely populated city in the US and home to over 8.5 million people, roughly 1.6 million residents lack broadband connectivity, as the table below demonstrates.\nImage: IHS Markit and the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA)\nCity connections\nTo tackle this, New York is focusing on providing people with IT and technology skills, as well as providing improved internet access throughout the city.\nFor example, the OneNYC initiative, launched by mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015, aims to provide every resident and business in New York with access to adequate and affordable broadband by 2025.\nLast year, the project helped provide free Wi-Fi to around 3,500 residents, and offered dedicated support for senior citizens as well as for young people and their families.\nAnother project launched by the de Blasio administration, called LinkNYC, included repurposing New York\xe2\x80\x99s payphone infrastructure with free Wi-Fi. According to LinkNYC, at least 7,500 payphone kiosks will be installed in the city by 2025, providing superfast broadband for residents.\nClosing the digital divide\nThe report also highlights the digital divide among those from rural areas, where the average proportion of unconnected people across the eight nations analyzed is 44%.\nIn addition to lower rates of connectivity, rural populations often have to contend with less reliable and slower internet than those living in towns and cities.\nIn the US alone, well over 16 million residents from rural areas lack broadband, which is equivalent to 28% of the rural population, as the table below highlights.\nImage: IHS Markit and the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA)\nSocial change organization Connect Americans Now (CAN) is trying to tackle this issue, promising to bring reliable and affordable broadband to all Americans living in rural areas by 2022.\nAccording to CAN, the most effective way to improve connectivity is via a combination of wired and wireless technologies, and by leveraging a range of bandwidths, such as the 700 MHz frequency range. The group claims this would enable wireless signals to travel over hills and through buildings and trees.\nChallenges in rural America, however, are far less pronounced than in other nations, particularly in India where 87% of the rural population lacks broadband access.\nFortunately for its citizens, India has developed plans at a country-wide level to expand digitization and develop \xe2\x80\x9csmart cities\xe2\x80\x9d.\nIts Smart Cities Mission and Challenge project includes retrofitting and redeveloping existing areas to improve communications infrastructure and broadband connectivity.\nHowever, it is the UK and Germany that lead the charge in terms of rural connectivity. Almost 90% of residents in rural Britain have access to broadband, while in Germany around 82% of the rural population is connected.\nImage: IHS Markit and the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA)\nHave

Thanks asshole Mayor !\nJanuary 20, 2018 at 3:28 PM\nJQ LLC\nsaid...\nI wonder if these things are going to be used to determine congestion pricing as Mario\'s son Governor Cuomo boasted about last week."Does DiBlah get a kickback every time one is installed?"No doubt, consider the recent expose on a demoted pay slashed aide who complained about a staffer getting promoted for arranging the rat bag contract.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/nyregion/retaliation-lawsuit-de-blasio.html\nJanuary 20, 2018 at 4:28 PM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nThe reality is that a certain kind of street-homeless will use the kiosk as a base to plant themselves.\nSome of them spend all day or night there.\nIt\'s called loitering.\nAnd sometimes, not always, but sometimes they have a shopping cart and create a nuisance to other New Yorkers just trying to walk by on the sidewalk.\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 3:42 AM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nWill this be the New New Super Pee Phone\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 4:21 AM\nNOTORIOUS\nsaid...\nGrieve didn\xe2\x80\x99t editorialize the photo at all. You\xe2\x80\x99re projecting. That photo is reality.\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 9:30 AM\nsophocles\nsaid...\nI\'m sympathetic with providing phone and internet access for street persons. But I\'m not sure why they had to be through these urban monstrosities. Libraries generally have internet access, so the add on value for these is the free phone calls...\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 11:16 AM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nIn the meeting where someone first said "Hey, let\'s install a bunch of free wi-fi and phone charging kiosks all over the city" the very first reply should\'ve been "What, so all the homeless and mentally ill can campout next to them and freeload for hours on end?" The reply to that should\'ve been "Yeah actually, you\'re right. I didn\'t think it through. Bad idea." and then the reply to that should\'ve been "Ok, moving on to the next item on the agenda..."\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 12:06 PM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nBS 11:42am. Homeless people can get in touch with people, set appointments etc. without these things which are a waste of money. I don\'t buy your argument one bit, besides it\'s an undignified way for a homeless person to do those things which should be done in the warmth, safety, privacy, and dignity of an indoor location not outside on the street. In fact, doing those things outside further magnifies their homelessness and stigmatizes them (they\'re too undesirable to use a phone, set a doctor\'s appointment etc. indoors.)\nJanuary 21, 2018 at 12:21 PM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nI know of a 3rd Avenue building where they filled the USB ports with super glue.\nOvernight there were no more homeless taking up residence by that kiosk.\nJanuary 22, 2018 at 8:49 AM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nGreat in theory....but yes just another block to avoid the crusties now. Couldn\'t they use the money they pour into these things to establish better shelters or centers where vulnerable people can make calls or use the internet in a safe indoor space? Or maybe install those self-cleaning bathrooms instead? Ultimately these kiosks just end up as a crusty\'s backrest while they harass people.\nJanuary 22, 2018 at 9:24 AM\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nWhat 9:24am said.\nJanuary 22, 2018 at 10:10 AM\nchris flash\nsaid...\nAs reported in the current issue of THE SHADOW, the Link NYC kiosks SPY on the public in two ways:\xe2\x80\xa2 Built-on cameras on either side constantly film pedestrians passing by\xe2\x80\xa2 When you plug in your device for any reason, all of your data is uploaded to the NYPDGet the FULL story in THE SHADOW, available at St. Marx Books 99 St. Marx), INK (Avenue A, between 3th + 5th Streets), Unoppressive Anti-Imperialist Books (34 Carmine Street) and Blue Stockings (162 Allen Street)There\'s always a hidden price to pay for "free" services....\nJanuary 22, 2018 at 6:51 PM\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nA Visit To archive\nA visit to Zadie\'s Oyster Room on 12th Street\nPhotos and interview by Stacie Joy\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an early summer thunderstorm brewing as I make my way over to Zadie\xe2\x80\x99s Oyster Room , 413 E. 12...\nWe love tips\nHave a story idea or tip about something happening in the East Village?

De acuerdo con la Organizaci\xc3\xb3n Mundial de la Salud, en menos de 35 a\xc3\xb1os dos tercios de las personas en todo el mundo vivir\xc3\xa1n en ciudades.De acuerdo con Business Insider, las ciudades que florecer\xc3\xa1n en el futuro son aquellas que est\xc3\xa9n dise\xc3\xb1adas a partir de las m\xc3\xa1s recientes tecnolog\xc3\xadas de alto nivel, lo que le dar\xc3\xa1 a sus habitantes la oportunidad y las herramientas para desarrollar nuevas innovacionesBusiness Insider consult\xc3\xb3 a la empresa de investigaci\xc3\xb3n especializada en ciudades innovadoras 2thinknow para clasificar a las ciudades de acuerdo con su nivel de adopci\xc3\xb3n, desarrollo y utilizaci\xc3\xb3n de las tecnolog\xc3\xadas de alto nivel. La firma eligi\xc3\xb3 10 factores relacionados con el avance tecnol\xc3\xb3gico incluyendo el n\xc3\xbamero de patentes presentadas per c\xc3\xa1pita, las startups, los capitalistas de riesgo tecnol\xc3\xb3gicos, el ranking en otros reportes sobre innovaci\xc3\xb3n y el nivel de uso de los tel\xc3\xa9fonos inteligentes compar\xc3\xa1ndolos y elaborando a partir de esta comparaci\xc3\xb3n una clasificaci\xc3\xb3n de las 25 ciudades m\xc3\xa1s tecnol\xc3\xb3gicas del mundo.1. San Francisco, California A todas las ciudades de la lista les gustar\xc3\xada tener su propio Silicon Valley. Desafortunadamente, Silicon Valley s\xc3\xb3lo hay uno y se encuentra en San Francisco. Ubicada en la costa este de Estados Unidos, en el estado de California, San Francisco es el epicentro de la actividad tecnol\xc3\xb3gica en el mundo, de acuerdo con Business Insider y 2thinknow, sobre todo porque Silicon Valley se las lleva todas en pr\xc3\xa1cticamente todas las categor\xc3\xadas porque la cadena de suministro de la innovaci\xc3\xb3n ha hecho su hogar all\xc3\xad .2. Nueva York, Nueva York De acuerdo con Business Insider, Nueva York es una ciudad especial cuando se trata de su infraestructura tecnol\xc3\xb3gica, en algunos casos es sumamente progresista y en otros, es incre\xc3\xadblemente progresista. En Nueva York existen alrededor de 7,000 empresas tecnol\xc3\xb3gicas de este nivel que brindan empleo a m\xc3\xa1s de 100,000 personas. De acuerdo con 2thinknow, Nueva York tambi\xc3\xa9n integra la tecnolog\xc3\xada a las calles de la urbe con la red de wifi gratuito LinkNYC que cuenta con m\xc3\xa1s de 500 puntos de conexi\xc3\xb3n en la zona de Manhattan.3. Londres, Inglaterra El Crossrail ha convertido a la capital de Inglaterra en el lugar ideal para usar el transporte p\xc3\xbablico y esto es justamente lo que coloca a esta ciudad en los primeros tres lugares de la lista. De acuerdo con Business Insider, en el 2018, ser\xc3\xa1n inauguradas 10 nuevas l\xc3\xadneas de tren que conectar\xc3\xa1n 30 estaciones ya existentes. Adem\xc3\xa1s, la capital londinense cuenta con m\xc3\xa1s start-ups que cualquier otra ciudad del mundo y seg\xc3\xban 2thinknow, hay estimaciones de que en la pr\xc3\xb3xima d\xc3\xa9cada se crear\xc3\xa1n 11,000 trabajos relacionados con la tecnolog\xc3\xada.. Los Angeles, California La Corporaci\xc3\xb3n de Desarrollo Econ\xc3\xb3mico de los Angeles, California, indic\xc3\xb3 en un informe del 2014 que la ciudad tiene m\xc3\xa1s empleos en el sector de alta tecnolog\xc3\xada que cualquier otra en Estados Unidos. Adem\xc3\xa1s, el informe indica que la generaci\xc3\xb3n de riqueza gracias a la inversi\xc3\xb3n en tecnolog\xc3\xada ronda los 58,000 millones de d\xc3\xb3lares y de acuerdo con 2thinknow, tanto las startups como el capital que ha entrado a la ciudad juegan un papel sumamente importante en el sector tecnol\xc3\xb3gico de alto nivel de Los Angeles.5. Se\xc3\xbal, Corea del Sur Seg\xc3\xban Business Insider, Se\xc3\xbal ha sido llamada la ciudad del futuro. El dise\xc3\xb1o de la ciudad hace que \xc3\xa9sta compita directamente con otras urbes de esta lista, como Nueva York. De acuerdo con 2thinknow, en la capital de Corea se archivan m\xc3\xa1s patentes que en cualquier otra metr\xc3\xb3poli en el mundo. La LTE es un est\xc3\xa1ndar de comunicaciones en todo el mundo que justamente dio inicio en esta ciudad oriental, lo mismo que la tendencia a consumir productos v\xc3\xada digital.6. Taipei, Taiw\xc3\xa1n Taipei es la capital del dise\xc3\xb1o industrial. De acuerdo con 2thinknow, la ciudad ha sido la meca del dise\xc3\xb1o de productos industriales desde hace varios a\xc3\xb1os, sobre todo cuando se trata de hardware para las computadoras. \xc3\x89sta es la raz\xc3\xb3n de que compa\xc3\xb1\xc3\xadas como Asus, Gigabyte y Acer llamen su hogar a esta urbe.7. Boston, Massachusetts De universidades como Harvard, Tufts y Northeastern han salido tecnolog\xc3\xadas de alto nivel, sobre todo en los campos de la biotecnolog\xc3\xada y la rob\xc3\xb3tica. Compa\xc3\xb1\xc3\xadas como Facebook, que tiene sus oficinas centrales en California, han fundado oficinas de investigaci\xc3\xb3n y desarrollo (I+D), y otras muchas peque\xc3\xb1as empresas y laboratorios de innovaci\xc3\xb3n han logrado establecerse en esta ciudad que cuenta con varios inversionistas de capital de riesgo, como Ventures Bater\xc3\xada, Venture Atlas, Bessemer Venture Partners, Matrix Venture Partners.8. Singapur, Singapur Singapur es un hervidero de tecnolog\xc3\xada. La cantidad de programadores y de inversionistas de capital de riesgo hacen que la ciudad est\xc3\xa9 en constante transformaci\xc3\xb3n, con infraestructura y tecnolog\xc3\xada de alto nivel, que incluye la construcci\xc3\xb3n de un bosque en el centro de un edificio, adem\xc3\xa1s de que la ciudad ha hecho una alianza con el MIT para desplazar la utilizaci\xc3\xb3n del autom\xc3\xb3vil e impulsar el uso del transporte p\xc3\xbablico.9. Toronto, Canad\xc3\xa1 Seg\xc3\xban Business Insider, Toronto da cabida a un tercio de todas las empresas tecnol\xc3\xb3gicas de Canad\xc3\xa1. Esto significa que de cada tres empresas tecnol\xc3\xb3gicas, una se encuentra en esta urbe. La mayor\xc3\xada de estas empresas no cuentan con m\xc3\xa1s de 50 empleados, lo que implica que se trata de compa\xc3\xb1\xc3\xadas j\xc3\xb3venes que actualmente representan una ganancia anual de 52,000 millones de d\xc3\xb3lares y que en el futuro pueden valer mucho m\xc3\xa1s.10. Chicago, Illinois La zona del medio este de Estados Unidos, compuesta por estados como Kansas, Wisconsin, Indiana e Illinois no es el \xc3\xa1rea que se espera que aparezca en esta lista, pero la ciudad de Chicago, en Illinois est\xc3\xa1 demostrando lo contrario, de acuerdo con Business Insider. De acuerdo con un informe reciente, Illinois es uno de los cinco estados en todo el pa\xc3\xads con el mayor n\xc3\xbamero de empleos de alta tecnolog\xc3\xada. Adem\xc3\xa1s, de acuerdo con el Brookings Institute, Chicago es un centro neur\xc3\xa1lgico de la planificaci\xc3\xb3n urbana, que ha sido impulsado principalmente por City Digital, dise\xc3\xb1ada para resolver problemas relacionados con la transferencia de energ\xc3\xada y el transporte .11.

Link, the company behind the kiosks, is even offering to help New Yorkers "set up a special proposal" using the screens. But anyone popping the question might have to shuffle around other people charging their phones or making phone calls. "LinkNYC\'s digital displays feature fun facts about New York City, historic photos, important PSAs, and advertising that keeps our services free for all," Link President Jen Hensley said in a statement. "This Valentine\'s Day, you can use it to tell someone you love them \xe2\x80\x94 and even propose." The attempt at romance is Link\'s latest holiday-themed display on the kiosks, which had internet browsers until people reportedly spent hours camped out next to them playing music or watching smutty videos. The kiosks still allow free phone calls, maps and wireless internet connections. The company thinks it\'s solved that problem \xe2\x80\x94 loitering complaints dropped by 96 percent "immediately" after the web browsers were pulled in September 2016, a Link spokesman said.\nLink staff will review every tagged Instagram photo to make sure it\'s not too risque before putting it goes on the screens, the spokesman said. But every appropriate picture will likely be featured. Link will ask users for permission before broadcasting their photos, the company says.\nAnyone who wants to take the next step and propose with the LinkNYC screens should email hello@link.nyc.

Now, they\xe2\x80\x99re opening up that advertising space to local businesses\xe2\x80\x94for free.\nThe LinkLocal program launched last year as part of an effort to give a leg up to small businesses, said Kate Blumm, Assistant Commissioner for Communications at the NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have a strict code, but go on instinct,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blumm, describing\xc2\xa0which local businesses qualify for free ads. \xe2\x80\x9cMom and pop, new and longstanding independent businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t have big advertising budgets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBklyner reporting is supported by our subscribers and:\nBusinesses are able to fill out a short online questionnaire through City Bridge, Link\xe2\x80\x99s sponsoring partner, which asks the name of the company and what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re advertising, before creating ads for the company.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s shockingly easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blumm. With advertisers like Poland Spring and Jet Blue able to purchase plenty of ad space on Link kiosks, Blumm said the purpose of the program is to make sure local businesses are as visible as possible.\nThe ads run on area Links for one month, said Blumm, but business have opportunities to sign up again through different local promotions.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt felt too good to be true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty Cooney, executive director of the Graham BID, which has 8 Link kiosks on its stretch of Graham Avenue in Williamsburg.\nAs far as the efficacy of the ads go? Time will tell.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a holding pattern,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cooney. It is often difficult to judge the response to online advertising,\xc2\xa0she added, since customers aren\xe2\x80\x99t walking in with physical flyers or coupons. \xe2\x80\x9cBut from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, businesses feel they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a good return.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCooney said she finds the 9-foot tall glowing kiosks \xe2\x80\x9creassuring,\xe2\x80\x9d and said that their visibility in the evening, when everything is closed, makes pedestrians feel less alone. They remind her of the old red emergency boxes on street corners, she said. Link kiosks have a button that can be used to call 911 in an emergency.\nLast September, DNA Info reported that in North Brooklyn, LinkNYC kiosks were being used to arrange for drug sales, but on Graham Avenue, Cooney said that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the BID managers meeting, some worried about abuse [of the kiosks],\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the exception to the rule. The plusses outweigh the negatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLink kiosks aren\xe2\x80\x99t just for advertising businesses, though, said Blumm. 5% of their ad space is reserved for New York City PSAs, from emergency preparedness notes from the Office of Emergency Management to reminders to sign up for healthcare via the Get Covered New York campaign. New Yorkers can actually use the kiosks to sign up for healthcare right on the street, Blumm said.\nAdditionally, the kiosks advertise local interest: reminders about Community Board meetings and information about how to find polling places. In June, during Caribbean Heritage Month, one campaign raised awareness of the contributions made by Caribbean-Americans.\nNever miss the day\'s stories!\nLeave this field empty if you\'re human: This page is available to subscribers.

How can cities harness all the data at their disposal \xe2\x80\x94 on things like traffic, crime, health and income \xe2\x80\x94 and use it to eliminate the most common woes of urban living? At its core, the goal of a smart city is to improve the quality of life for its residents, by providing them good jobs, a clean environment and safe, sustainable infrastructure.\nBut as cities race to implement technology that can respond to the needs of its citizens, concerns over things like privacy, ownership and the energy needed to power millions of data-collecting sensors have increased right along with it.\nEverything Is Connected\nThough the term \xe2\x80\x9csmart city\xe2\x80\x9d is relatively new, the concept of cities using data to inform policies isn\xe2\x80\x99t. More than a decade ago, for example, Seattle passed an\xc2\xa0ordinance that instructed its department of transportation to conduct a\xc2\xa0data analysis of city streets, taking into account traffic patterns, speed limits and collision history with the goal of encouraging residents to walk, bike and ride public transit more often.\nMore recently in 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation launched the\xc2\xa0Smart City Challenge. A total of 78 mid-size cities responded, presenting ideas for revolutionizing their highways, roads and public-transit systems through the use of data, applications and other technology. (The winner: Columbus, Ohio.)\nBesides easing the burdens of city life for residents, technology plays a major role in keeping them safe, too, especially as America\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure rating\xc2\xa0continues its steady decline across the board.\nIn September 2016, a team of engineers from Michigan State University and Washington University in St. Louis put self-monitoring\xc2\xa0stress sensors on the Mackinac Bridge \xe2\x80\x94 one of the longest suspension bridges in the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 to log information on wear and tear, and send alerts when maintenance or repairs are needed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese sensors are going to continuously monitor the health of the structure, and if something goes wrong, then it\xe2\x80\x99s going to report that to the cloud,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0said Shantanu Chakrabartty, one of the sensors\xe2\x80\x99 developers. \xe2\x80\x9cIf something happens, you can go back and see that a certain part of the structure experienced abnormal levels of strain, and then according to that, you can schedule your emergency response and your maintenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMichigan\xe2\x80\x99s Mackinac Bridge features self-monitoring sensors that measure wear and tear and increase safety.Photo by Jim Feng/Getty Images\nA New Model Emerges\nHalf the fun of envisioning a smart city isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the nifty gadgets that make roads more stable, water cleaner or traffic lighter. What\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting for many engineers and developers is the idea of making a city responsive to the people who live there.\nAn example is New York\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC program, which is replacing thousands of pay phones around the city with kiosks that provide free Wi-Fi, phone calls, device-charging stations and touchscreen tablets that connect residents and tourists to city services and maps.\nA more futuristic example is Sidewalk Toronto \xe2\x80\x94 a partnership between Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company, and Waterfront Toronto, a local organization charged with the revitalization of the city\xe2\x80\x99s waterfront. The goal: Design an entirely new neighborhood on the city\xe2\x80\x99s east side that will include sustainably built homes, roads designed for self-driving cars and green spaces that can adapt to how people act within them. (\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s using that bench? Let\xe2\x80\x99s try moving it to a sunnier area then.\xe2\x80\x9d) If a tech company took over urban planning, this is what it might look like.\nPrivate-Public Partnerships Put to the Test\nBut despite the competing interests of the private sector, which looks for ways to monetize its efforts, and the public sector, whose goal is to provide free services, there is the sense that tech companies will eventually be viewed as trustworthy gatekeepers of data \xe2\x80\x94 so long as they provide benefits to the city.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a change in outlook,\xe2\x80\x9d Roman Serdar Mendle, smart cities program manager at the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives,\xc2\xa0said a brief. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past, those concerned with sustainable cities saw the private sector as bad, and governments and NGOs as the ones that were fighting the good fight. Now companies are seen as the solutions providers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd then there is the confusion about who actually owns the data being harvested: the outside companies hired to collect it through sensors and other means, or the local officials who rely on it to make their cities smarter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in the learning business, that is wholly true,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tracey Cook, executive director for \xc2\xa0Municipal Licensing & Standards for the City of Toronto. By regulating Uber, for example, the city was able to gather data on every single trip that occured, down to where people were getting picked up and dropped off, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin inches.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat information could inform the city\xe2\x80\x99s future endeavors with Sidewalk Toronto, for example.\nAs cities become more reliant on the private sector to fill gaps that government can\xe2\x80\x99t, the way forward, it seems, is two-fold: Cities will continue to use the data it collects on its citizens with the goal of improving their lives, and then partner with for-profit companies to ease concerns on privacy.\nA New York City resident uses a LinkNYC kiosk to access free Wi-Fi, calling and other digital services.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\nThe Future Is (Almost) Imminent\nAt first blush, smart cities sound like the ultimate solution for bridging the opportunity divide by giving people in all neighborhoods equal access to technology, creating a sort of digital utopia. But a backlash is brewing, not only over reasons of privacy but also over resources. The more a city relies on the Internet of Things \xe2\x80\x94 an interconnected network of devices that communicate with each other \xe2\x80\x94 the more energy is needed to power said \xe2\x80\x9cthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCurrently, 7 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s internet is used by the information technology sector, with that percentage expected to triple within the next two years. Annual Bitcoin transactions, for example, consume as much energy as the entire country of Iraq, according to the Bitcoin Energy Index.\nAs more and more people flock to urban areas, a partnership between tech companies and the services people use every day in a city \xe2\x80\x94 be it public buses or green spaces \xe2\x80\x94 is warranted. But given the privacy and environmental concerns that have yet to be addressed, the full-on smart city still has its obstacles.\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\ndata-driven solution smart city smart infrastructure Sustainable Cities Technology\nComments\nGet the best of NationSwell in your inbox.\nYou Might Like\nMaking Government Work\nJuly 21, 2014\nThese Solar-Powered Roads Transmit Helpful Information onto Your Windshield\nMaking Government Work\nMarch 20, 2014\nHow an Innovative Parking Program May Cut Downtown Traffic by One Third\nMaking Government Work\nJune 23, 2014\nD.C., New York City and Boston Named Tops for Foot Traffic\nNationswell champions solutions to America\xe2\x80\x99s problems and supports the people making them happen\nHome\nStudio\nCouncil\nTeam\nCareers\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nCreated with Sketch.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nGet the best of NationSwell in your inbox.\nAll content copyright \xc2\xa92019 NationSwell.

They will begin showing content on Thursday.IntersectionShareBy Marty Swant|February 6, 2018\nShareOlympics fans in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia will soon have a way to catch up with the 2018 Winter Olympics without looking down at their phones during their commute.Later this week, NBC Olympics will begin showcasing content from\xc2\xa0Pyeongchang, South Korea\xe2\x80\x94videos and visuals such as highlights, summaries, previews, medal counts and athlete bios\xe2\x80\x94on digital displays on streets and in mass transit systems in those three cities. Through a partnership with Intersection, a New York-based smart cities and media company, NBC hopes to broaden its Olympics footprint while reminding people to watch the games on TV or on NBC\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app.According to\xc2\xa0NBC Olympics President Gary Zenkel, the goal is to reach viewers beyond their usual consumption habits. Since there is a 14-hour time difference between the East Coast and South Korea, Zenkel said he hopes it will also provide ongoing content even though the games are half a world away. That means having highlights from the night before during the morning commute in the U.S. to show people what happened while they were still sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a real-time presence of Olympic content that\xe2\x80\x99s accompanying people who are either heading to work or doing what they do as they maneuver the streets of New York, Philly and Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Adweek during an interview from South Korea.Starting Thursday, around 4,000 digital displays will begin showing Olympics content for about three to six minutes every hour. The New York City monoliths stand 9.5 feet tall, and have 55-inch display screens. Zenkel said the goal is to increase the \xe2\x80\x9cappetite\xe2\x80\x9d for Olympics content.The idea came about a couple of months ago after Zenkel noticed the LinkNYC stands around New York. Soon after that, Zenkel ran into Intersection chief revenue officer Marta Martinez and decided to contact her later to learn more about the displays.\xe2\x80\x9cI saw these kiosks popping up on what felt like at least every city block and in some cases corners and was intrigued,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Zenkel said.This is the first major content play for Intersection, which has digital display partnerships with a number of major cities in the U.S. Screens can show all kinds of content, including ads like Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Shark Tank-style show, \xe2\x80\x9cPlanet of the Apps,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as offer free Wi-Fi. Other Intersection markets include Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis and most recently Los Angeles.The Olympics content will be displayed across the 1,300 LinkNYC kiosks in New York; on digital panels and displays in the Chicago Transit Authority system; and on bus shelters, urban panels and other displays in Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s mass transit system and streets.\xe2\x80\x9cIt ties back to our core mission, which is to improve [the] daily life of cities through technology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Intersection CEO Ari Buchalter. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a big part of that is around delivering unique and powerful content experiences in the public space, in particular those that are sort of human-scale, look-up experiences as opposed to the content that people often consume on their mobile phones.\xe2\x80\x9dThe initial plan late last year was to find advertisers among NBC\xe2\x80\x99s existing content sponsors. However, Zenkel said the plan came together just before the games were set to begin, and the two companies decided not to exchange any money\xe2\x80\x94unless they\xe2\x80\x99re able to find an advertiser at the last minute.\xe2\x80\x9cThe Olympics is a uniquely massive event,\xe2\x80\x9d Zenkel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone who walks down the street seeing some great Olympic content is going to say, \xe2\x80\x98Hmm, how did this end up here?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dBuchalter said Intersection is also in talks to bring other types of content to public spaces. That might include news, social media, local info or cultural content. Buchalter said revenue agreements depend on each contract. However, the share with LinkNYC, a joint partnership with New York City, is split in half.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only see an ad, then you eventually become blind to that space,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

LinkNYC, meanwhile, gets to showcase new programming and collect data on how audiences on the street interact with the content.\nFrom there, LinkNYC can develop a more tailored pitch for advertisers that might range from the store right beside the kiosk to a national brand looking to do a citywide takeover.\nThe product of a public-private partnership, LinkNYC has an\xc2\xa0ad revenue-sharing arrangement\xc2\xa0with the city that requires it to deliver $500 million during the first 12 years of the agreement. The deal with NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Olympics division will also bring the customized content to digital networks in Chicago and Philadelphia operated by Intersection.\nAccording to Intersection CEO Ari Buchalter, there will be more programming partnerships of this kind.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking to a large number of folks that have unique and engaging content, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s news, entertainment, sports or local stories, so we can test and experiment [and see] what content people want to experience in that setting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we can see what is the best way\xe2\x80\x9d for advertisers to sponsor the content people want to see and develop strategies related to it.\nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s programming also could reintroduce LinkNYC to New Yorkers who know of it chiefly as the Wi-Fi hub that, for a period in 2016, attracted users who watched pornography on its interactive tablet. The company solved that problem by disabling the tablet\xe2\x80\x99s web browser.\nRelated Articles\nHBO surpasses 5 million U.S. online subscribers\nPrince's former manager Londell McMillan explains Jay-Z's beef with him\nDolan, Garden keeping WNBA's Liberty for now\nUnlimited-movie deal could be too good to survive\nSale of Harvey Weinstein's company up in air after lawsuit\nFilm and TV parking workers vote to unionize\nA relaunch for Gothamist, but not for DNAinfo\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain's New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain's Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

Streets\nLinkNYC kiosks will broadcast highlights, athlete profiles and other features from the PyongChang games.\nBy Noah Manskar, Patch Staff\nFeb 7, 2018 5:45 pm ET\n{{ replyButtonLabel }}\nReply\n{{ replyCount }}\nNEW YORK, NY \xe2\x80\x94 Why watch the 2018 Winter Olympics indoors when you can see them outside, in the actual winter? The city\'s LinkNYC kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 known for providing free WiFi and, previously, unsavory entertainment \xe2\x80\x94 will screen videos fresh from the games in PyeongChang, South Korea, which start Friday. NBC Olympics and Intersection, a technology and media company, will broadcast a special package of Olympics-themed features to New York\'s more than 1,200 Link screens, as well as displays in Chicago and Philadelphia. The kiosks will show highlights from the games each morning, previews of events during primetime, athlete profiles, medal counts and other videos showcasing the world\'s favorite winter sports.\nThe goal is to get some of America\'s urbanites to watch the Olympics in "entirely new ways," said Intersection\'s CEO, Ari Buchalter. That means New Yorkers could catch up on curling while walking to the subway or learn about your favorite bobsledder while getting a bagel. "Emerging media platforms like the LinkNYC network in New York City represent another way for NBCUniversal to reassemble the television audience by extending the reach of our Olympic coverage, content and promotion to spaces where the American audience now consumes media," Gary Zenkel, the president of NBC Olympics, said in a statement.\nEighteen athletes from New York State will be part of the U.S. team at this year\'s Olympics. Coincidentally, the LinkNYC kiosks will be plastered with cute couple photos on Valentine\'s Day, about five days after the opening ceremonies.

It will be streamed across the LinkNYC network in New York; digital urban panels and platform displays in Chicago; and displays on streets and transit platforms in Philadelphia.\nThe events, which take place this year in PyeongChang, South Korea, begin on Feb. 9 and conclude on Feb. 25.\nDive Insight:\nIntersection, a company that prides itself on "delivering connectivity, information and content that elevate the urban experience," made a splash in the smart cities world when it partnered with Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes to roll-out the LinkNYC network in 2016. The kiosks offer a variety of services including high-speed Wi-Fi, device charging and a touch screen tablet for access to maps and direction, and their popularity in the city sparked the company\'s spin-off collaborations with Philadelphia, Seattle and the U.K.\nKey Features\nFree Wi-Fi\nEvery Link is equipped with free, gigabit Wi-Fi, allowing access to high-speed services - about 100 times faster than basic public Wi-Fi.\nDirections\nA touch screen tablet allows users to access city services and maps, and provides step-by-step directions to destinations or cross streets.\nFree Calls\nThe touch screen tablet is equipped with a microphone, tactile keypad and Vonage app, allowing users to make free calls anywhere in the U.S.\nEmergency Calls\nA red button below the tablet allows users to instantly connect with 911 in the case of an emergency.\nUSB Ports\nTwo USB ports, connected directly to power sources, allow users to charge devices without the risk of data exchange with the kiosk.\nAd Space\nEach Link has two 55" high-def digital screens, allowing for public service announcement and advertising opportunities.\nUntil now, the digital screens that hug the sides of the 10-foot kiosks were mainly used for advertising purposes, or in some cases, to show historic photos from the city\'s digital archives. With the NBC partnership, Intersection is unlocking the full potential of its kiosks and digital platforms by truly bridging a digital divide and allowing folks who may not have cable access to indulge in the worldwide events. "Our content partnership reflects a new approach to storytelling in cities," said Ari Buchalter, CEO of Intersection, in a press statement.\nIf the 17-day custom content coverage is deemed successful, Intersection will likely be approached by other networks that wish to leverage the opportunity to expose their content to a more inclusive audience. The "digital storytelling" concept could be expanded to other companies\' or cities\' digital screens as well, including subway kiosks and billboards.\nRecommended Reading:\nDigital Signage Connection\nNBC Olympics Partners with Intersection to Deliver Custom Content of the Pyeongchang Olympic Winter Games\nAdWeek\nNBC Will Show Winter Olympics Content on 4,000 Outdoor Displays in 3 U.S. Cities\nFollow\nKristin Musulin\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nWikimedia Commons\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Smart Cities Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nSmart Cities Dive\nTopics covered: energy, green building, transportation, waste solutions, connectivity, policy and more.\nDaily\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

Monthly active users did fall short of expectations, though, coming in 2 million less than estimated at about 330 million.The Winter Olympics are finally here. NBC will have 1,800 hours of event coverage over the next two weeks, but unlike the Super Bowl, NBC is not giving it away for free. If you have cable, you can stream all the events on NBC\'s sports app. But if you\'re a cord-cutter, NBC has partnered with tech company Intersection and will provide Olympic highlights on platform displays, LinkNYC Wi-Fi networks and other transit hubs across New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.Amazon will start delivering Whole Foods on its fastest service, Prime Now.

B63-riders, did you see/try this? Any feedback? We\xe2\x80\x99re working w/ @LinkNYC & @NYCDoITT @NYC_DOT @MTA to make it easier, more useful & eventually citywide. pic.twitter.com/ruJEepdiYC\xe2\x80\x94 Brad Lander (@bradlander) February 7, 2018So\xc2\xa0Lander, who represents Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens and Borough Park, said his office has been working with\xc2\xa0Department of Transportation and the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications. Along the B63 bus route in Park Slope, bus riders can head to the kiosks and check when the next bus is due to arrive. Lander said the feature has been added to about 20 kiosks along the route on 5th Avenue.Lander said he\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to get bus countdown clocks installed in Park Slope for the last five years, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated and expensive process, with the price for each countdown clock at about $35,000. The LinkNYC kiosks seemed like they could be a quick fix for getting that functionality.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten decent feedback,\xe2\x80\x9d Lander said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope we could get to the point where nearly all Links that are close to buses or to the subway could act as countdown clocks.\xe2\x80\x9d AdvertisementFor now, the countdowns are only visible on the console of the kiosks. Lander would like to see countdowns displayed periodically on the side of the kiosks, available for all to see. He\xe2\x80\x99s working on that.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a million logistical reason why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as easy as it would seem,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\n-30-\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY, BECOME A MEMBER\nAlready a member?

Real-time countdown clocks of buses were added to to the public Wi-Fi hubs along the B63 route in the neighborhood with plans to extend it to all LinkNYC spots around the city if successful, Lander announced on Twitter. As part of the pilot, nearly 20 LinkNYC hubs on Fifth Avenue had the bus information added to them last week, Technica.ly reported. Spokespeople for LinkNYC and Lander did not respond to a request for comment on this article. Lander previously called on the city to add the data to LinkNYC in September as a way to increase the coverage of bus countdown clocks around Park Slope without costing the city money. "Many places the Links are currently are nearby or on the same block or in a location that\'s on the way \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s very convenient to bus riders," Lander previously told Patch.\n"Surely, when the next bus is coming is as valuable to New Yorkers as when the next community board meeting is. I hope Link will work with New York City to make this happen."\nThe LinkNYC replaced pay phones in every borough in the city to offer free Wi-Fi, USB charging, phone calls and a large tablet with maps and directions. The devices originally had the ability to browse the web but it was disabled in 2016 after residents complained people watched porn on them.

He provides subject matter expertise to CDW\xe2\x80\xa2G law enforcement customers with respect to digital intelligence and evidence management.\nWi-Fi and broadband internet access are integral to being an active and engaged citizen in today\'s world. Often, however, municipal internet projects are deployed in downtowns or affluent city centers while less economically developed areas are left behind, furthering the digital divide and isolating the advantages of technology to small sections of a city.\nTo close this gap, several cities have launched projects aimed at offering free, secure Wi-Fi across all regions of their city.\nSan Francisco announced in October its plans to offer residents 1-gigabit connections as part of a citywide $1.5 billion project.\n"Bridging the digital divide is right for our residents and right for the future of our city," San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said in a statement to SFGate.\nSIGN UP: Get more news from the StateTech newsletter in your inbox every two weeks!\nNew York Swaps Phone Booths with Hotspots\nBut not all cities can afford to build out Wi-Fi across the city from the ground up. For this reason, many cities are thinking creatively and launching projects that take advantage of upgrades to existing citywide infrastructure to outfit all areas of a region with Wi-Fi availability.\nIn New York City, officials took advantage of a project to remove outdated phone booths and replaced them with more than 900 Wi-Fi kiosks throughout the city. Each kiosk is outfitted with tablets, charging ports and displays with relevant information for residents alongside a Wi-Fi connection that residents, tourists and passersby can access.\nIt wasn\'t a breeze to get the project off the ground, however, Jeff Merritt, former director of innovation for the city, said at the 2017 Smart Cities Week conference.\n"When we came into office this project was dead," said Merritt. "Folks wanted to get rid of street clutter. Pay phones were an eyesore. There was an adverse reaction to the idea of putting digital advertisement on city streets. I think that we did the hard work of recognizing the opportunity that exists there."\nMerritt and his team moved quickly to get contracts in place that would replace the outdated infrastructure with strategically advantageous Wi-Fi kiosks and ended up with "something that far exceeded anything we could have ever come up with on our own," said Merritt. Now, the city plans to implement more than 7,500 kiosks as part of the project, but officials aren\'t being na\xc3\xafve about the need to update the newest infrastructure to meet future needs.\n"It requires us to think differently about hardware and infrastructure and think about it in a way that is modular and flexible," said Merritt. "We recognize that many of the components of LinkNYC will be outdated in a very short amount of time so the [kiosks] are built in a way that the actual individual module \xe2\x80\xa6 can easily be swapped in and out."\nPortland Upgrades Lamp Posts for Wi-Fi Access\nLamp posts aren\'t just for light anymore, at least not in Portland, Maine. In a bid to upgrade the city\'s lighting infrastructure, roll out connected technologies and, ultimately, save taxpayer dollars, the city council approved an $8.5 million project to revamp its streetlights downtown with LED lighting, Wi-Fi and other technologies. The move will ultimately generate $1 million in cost avoidance annually, the Portland Press Herald reports.\n"The bottom line here is there is literally nothing but upside to what is being proposed here," city councilor Justin Costa told the Herald.\nPhiladelphia Capitalizes on Failed Wi-Fi Projects\nCurrently ranked as America\'s poorest big city, Philadelphia officials believe that smart city projects, including a citywide Wi-Fi deployment, will be able to move the needle on its poverty rate by improving digital citizenship and opening the door to greater opportunity.\nIn order to make citywide Wi-Fi possible, officials are making use of existing human and technological infrastructure from a failed Wi-Fi project as a stepping stone to the new deployment.\n"It\'s a failed initiative by any standard, but some things came out of it that are pretty interesting," Andrew Buss, the deputy CIO for innovation management within Philadelphia\'s Office of Innovation and Technology, said at an event earlier this year. "Because everyone was so in to Wireless Philadelphia for that period of time, what ends up happening is we created all these really active communities around the topic of broadband \xe2\x80\x94 very committed people, community organizations, individuals, people who are excited about the issue."\nWireless Philadelphia was launched in 2004 and abandoned in 2008 when Earthlink dropped the project and it became clear that the underlying technology to achieve citywide goals simply weren\'t mature enough yet.\n"Wireless Philadelphia, in a way, was ahead of its time. The technology issues were not worked out," Buss said. "The technology changed faster than the city could implement the program, frankly, and that was a big challenge."\nWith new technology available, however, the new network should have no trouble keeping up.\nThis article is part of StateTech\'s CITizen blog series.

If you happen to be in New York City, you can catch your beloved\'s attention as they approach one of LinkNYC\'s Wi-Fi kiosks.For the second straight year, Link, which operates the LinkNYC Wi-Fi kiosks, has invited the marriage minded to post their proposals on the city\'s 1,280 LinkNYC kiosks for all passersby to see."We expect more proposals this year than last year," Ruth Fasoldt, Link\'s director of external affairs, told Kiosk Marketplace. Last year saw two marriage proposals on Link. So far this year, five are planned and more are expected.\xc2\xa0Tag Instagram love notesResidents who are not in\xc2\xa0marriage mode but feeling\xc2\xa0nonetheless amorous can tag their Valentine\'s Day entreaties on Instagram for a chance to be featured on the 55-inch digital displays throughout the city\'s five boroughs.Link will review every tagged Instagram photo to make sure it\'s not too risque before putting it on the screens. Every appropriate picture will likely be featured. Link will ask users for permission before posting their photos.Link has promoted the Valentine\'s Day campaign on the kiosks and through social media.Over 500 posts already"I\'ve just been so delighted to see all the different ways that love wins across New York City," said Kate Blumm, assistant commissioner for communications and external affairs for the city\'s department of information technology and telecommunications, noting that as of Tuesday afternoon (the day before Valentine\'s Day) there were more than 500 posts."It\'s everything from casual snapshots to more formal wedding pictures," she said. The city has promoted the campaign on\xc2\xa0its own social media channels.Blumm said the Valentine\'s Day promotion brings "community value" to residents."It enhances civic pride," she said. "It makes people feel a personal connection to the program. It makes it (the kiosk) less a hunk of metal and more of a community asset and something that they can have a human connection to.""We want to make sure that Links are bringing community value to the corners that they\'re on, and the more that people can see themselves reflected in the Links, the more valuable we think they\'ll be to New Yorkers," she added.More activities plannedLink is also celebrating Black History Month this month in New York City in partnership with a non-profit called Global Kids. Illustrations by students of famous black figures in science are being displayed on Links citywide."That\'s a very specific New York City, New Yorker driven way to commemorate Black History Month," Blumm said. "That\'s the kind of stuff we\'re going to continue to deepen over the course of the year.""The benefit to the city for Links in general is really vast," Blumm said. "We\'re replacing pay phones which have special places in the city\'s history but certainly are outdated in terms of their utility to New Yorkers.""We\'re going to continue to highlight the people, places and things that are special to New York City in particular," she said.Link kiosks allow residents to make domestic phone calls for free as well as provide access to city services. Residents were able to enroll in healthcare coverage up through the Jan. 31 enrollment deadline.Long-term benefits to accrue"Link is going above and beyond a traditional communications structure," Blumm said. "Not only is it at no cost to taxpayers, but the city of New York and the people of New York are guaranteed a minimum of $500 million over the life of the Link franchise."The revenue, generated by paid advertising, is paid to the city annually and will support city services. The kiosks have two panels that run digital advertising.Since New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 3.2 million people have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service.\xc2\xa0"They are certainly a flagship smart city innovation," Blumm said of the Link kiosks."The community engagement part of Link will always be important," Fastold said. The campaigns will always be tailored to the particular community being served. Outside of New York City, Link operates in the United Kingdom and will be operating in Philadelphia.Link has also done Instagram campaigns for other events, such as Fashion Week and Halloween.\xc2\xa0Topics: Advertising, Customer Experience, Government, Networking / Connectivity, Outdoor Kiosks, Wayfinding / Information Elliot MarasElliot Maras is the editor of KioskMarketplace.com and FoodTruckOperator.com.Sponsored Links:Related ContentKiosk Marketplace editor reviews 39 kiosk companies at National Restaurant ShowTaco Bell to install self-order kiosks in all stores in 2019 under its All Access initiativeSquare integration with Kiosk Pro app enables self-service for iPadsTaco Bell, Bell Canada Smart City Kiosks grab Elevate AwardsLatest ContentState-of-the-art testing: the first line of defense against fraudstersTexas Dairy Queen franchisee pioneers self-order kioskCashierless stores?

He\xe2\x80\x99s the author of\xc2\xa0NYC Basic Tips and Etiquette, a book of illustrations depicting the \xe2\x80\x9cunique habits and unspoken customs New Yorkers follow to make life bearable.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPyle, originally from Ohio, uses his black and white drawings to share helpful tips that he has learned through his own experiences of living in New York City. His illustrations cover all facets of city life, from how to deal with pole-hogs on the subway to how to photograph skyscrapers with your phone. The book also answers \xe2\x80\x9cburning questions\xe2\x80\x9d like: how do I hail a cab? What is a bodega?\xc2\xa0and most humorously, Do we need be touching right now? See below for a sampling of Pyle\xe2\x80\x99s work:\nAll images courtesy Harper Collins\nIn addition to these hilarious tidbits of advice, some of our favorite LinkNYC displays include fun facts about New York City, as well as historical photos of neighborhoods.

believes can be doubled.As part of the agreement between the two tourism promotion bodies, Cape Town\xe2\x80\x99s many attractions will appear on 62 bus shelters and over 1,000 outdoor LinkNYC kiosks across New York\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs.Cape Town Tourism CEO Enver Duminy explains how New York City will be promoted locally.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be wrapping up one of our mobile

In District 30, Councilmember Brad Lander has pushed for collaboration between the city and LinkNYC, with the goal of using the large advertising and communications kiosks to display wait times for nearby bus routes.\nLast fall, Lander put the price point of the clocks at about $35,000, and when one factors in the roughly 15,000 bus stops in Brooklyn, full coverage doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely anytime soon.

In New York, it\xe2\x80\x99s even possible to overlook the fact that many have been replaced by Wi-Fi capable, phone charging, tablet-wielding kiosks all over the city. LinkNYC is a network of slim, tall booths that offer a number of services to visitors and residents of New York. Perhaps the most useful is free, fast WI-Fi access, that lets you stay connected free of charge when you\xe2\x80\x99re out and about in the city. The Links also provide free domestic phone calls, maps, directions, a USB port for charging, and a 911 button for emergencies. The project to install the network has been ambitious. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen LinkNYC is fully built out it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the largest, fastest municipal Wi-Fi network anywhere in the world. So we definitely have a go big or go home mentality. It\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible resource both for New Yorkers and visitors, at no cost to the taxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kate Blumm, Assistant Commissioner, Communications & External Affairs at NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications, in an interview.Phones can be charged at the stations\xc2\xa9 LinkNYCThe reason there\xe2\x80\x99s no cost to New York\xe2\x80\x99s residents is that the whole network is funded by advertising. The Link kiosks have two digital screens on either side, which can display advertising, among other things. They\xe2\x80\x99re provided by the City of New York and a New York-based consortium called CityBridge that includes chip maker Qualcomm and Intersection, a company funded by Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent firm Alphabet. \xe2\x80\x9cOld payphones had static advertisements on three sides, and our new Links have digital advertising on two sides, and we split the revenue 50-50 [with the city,]\xe2\x80\x9d says Ruth Fasoldt, Director of External Affairs at LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cOur 50% also pays for the entire project, and we also use the 55-inch screens for other things beyond advertising. We have content up there that can be useful for residents and visitors alike, subway updates, weather updates, fun facts about New York City, and we\xe2\x80\x99re growing that content all the time.\xe2\x80\x9dThe program, which started rolling out in 2016, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been without its controversies. There was a problem with users accessing pornographic content on the browser later that year, which was fixed by limiting the sites accessible via the kiosk. And there have also been privacy concerns raised, particularly as the booths have forward-facing cameras. Citizens opposed to the cameras began putting post-it notes on the cameras, only for them to be taken down. The New York Civil Liberties Union has also complained about the LinkNYC network, saying in a letter to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio: \xe2\x80\x9cthe NYCLU remains concerned about the vast amount of private information retained by the LinkNYC system and the lack of robust language in the privacy policy protecting users against unwarranted government surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9dLinkNYC has been operational since 2016\xc2\xa9 LinkNYCBut despite these concerns, the project has aimed to bring connectivity to every New York resident and visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mayor has said publicly and is 100% right\xe2\x80\x94the internet is like water in 21st-century New York City,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Blumm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a luxury, and not just access to internet, access to high speed internet. Adults need it to look for jobs, and to manage their resources, kids need it as part of their education. Every New Yorker and visitor deserves the right to have it.\xe2\x80\x9dIn order to make the kiosks more visible to busy New Yorkers, several campaigns have been launched to attract attention. One of the more recent examples was on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when people were encouraged to tag photos of them and their Valentine on Instagram, to be in the running to be featured on the side of a Link kiosk. There were also plans to arrange for visitors and residents who intended to propose to do so via a message on the side of a Link. Aside from these types of campaigns, the main goal for LinkNYC in the future is to expand the network. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still in the third year of an eight-year rollout. It will keep growing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to walk pretty much the whole of Manhattan while being connected to this Wi-Fi the whole time. We have 1,300 links that are live across the five boroughs so far, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have thousands more. We\xe2\x80\x99re already up to 3.3 million devices having connected, which is larger than Chicago. It\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting to see where we\xe2\x80\x99re going,\xe2\x80\x9d says Fasoldt.

There won\xe2\x80\x99t be any footage of flames lapping up from the basement or smoke inhalation victims being wheeled into ambulances through the drizzling gloom\xe2\x80\x94not tonight anyway. The rain makes shootings unlikely too, in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, but there might be car crashes, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re bad enough those can sell.Thirty-two, but with the short-cropped hair and stubble mustache of a fresh police recruit, Adam is what\xe2\x80\x99s known in local news as a stringer: the photographers and videographers that cruise the city documenting accidents, crimes, disasters of all sizes in the hopes of selling their footage to media outlets faster than their competitors. His black tactical jacket and safety vest are partly inspired by a former obsession with airsoft guns, while the big velcro PRESS patches adorning them are ripped from the playbook of Scott Lane, the LA stringer documented in the Netflix series Shot in the Dark. (Of the three companies featured in a show described by reviewers as \xe2\x80\x9csleazy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9ctasteless\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cundiluted rubbernecking\xe2\x80\x9d, Lane\xe2\x80\x99s LoudLabs is presented as the most morally bankrupt.) New York City doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any stringer companies yet, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what Adam\xe2\x80\x94who asked us not to use his last name in this article and goes by the moniker Adam West on social media\xe2\x80\x94has been working on for the past two months with NYC911News.AdvertisementInside his dark grey Ford Fusion is a utility belt of tools: two smartphones clipped above the car\xe2\x80\x99s sat-nav and three dispatch radios running up to an antenna jutting out of the sunroof to increase their range, tuned to the frequencies of the FDNY, NYPD Special Operations Division (SOD), and the third swapping constantly to local precincts, the codes for which Adam has memorized. One phone displays incidents reported to the Citizen app while the other chirps out Twitter alerts from select accounts and tips through a Whatsapp group run by a Daily News photographer. The effect is overwhelming. Driving most days for Uber, Lyft, Juno, and Via, he\xe2\x80\x99s grown used to being the servant of many masters. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we decide to go to a [stringer] job we\xe2\x80\x99re assuming the risk that we may not get paid. Whereas when I answer an Uber job and I press \xe2\x80\x98accept trip\xe2\x80\x99 I know I\xe2\x80\x99m getting something. There\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee of how much, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a guarantee of something,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. With its gadgets and metal push bumpers, passengers routinely mistake his Fusion for a cop car. The only difference with riders in his car is that Adam sends the audio from SOD into an Secret Service-style earpiece, filming between trips if proximity and opportunity align.Parked outside a McDonalds in Gowanus where he\xe2\x80\x99s just devoured a cheeseless triple cheeseburger, one of his three radios crackles and Adam mentally decodes: precinct, location, accident type, working the calculus of its value to New York TV and digital media by instinct. A car has struck a tree in Elmhurst and it might be a pinjob\xe2\x80\x94the sort of crash where people are trapped inside the vehicle. That could sell. We beeline for the BQE, only slowing down to scope out two stalled vehicles in front of the Kosciuszko bridge. A car behind us honks and Adam half-jokes, \xe2\x80\x9cHe must not know what I do.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisementCar collided with tree in Elmhurst.Photo:\nBryan Menegus (Gizmodo)At 98th and 23rd the front end of the white Nissan is mutilated. Adam pulls his camera and shoulder rig out of the trunk and goes to film. No pin, and no passengers. An eyewitness claims two people fled the car on foot after it crashed, but neither he nor the cops seem to know why. Adam shoots 30 seconds of footage from a few angles and we find another staging area to idle in\xe2\x80\x94someplace near a highway and a Link NYC public wi-fi terminal so he can upload the footage to Google Drive. We end up in front of the Quays, a local Irish bar in Astoria.AdvertisementAll the footage from an event becomes a package, and a good package can net $100 to $300 per hit. Get a few outlets to buy it and that can easily become $1,000 per job. The ruined Nissan probably won\xe2\x80\x99t sell, but Adam uploads it anyway, shooting an email off to New York 1, CBS, Pix 11, and a dozen other stations, agonizing over whether midnight should be referred to as Saturday night or Sunday morning. Certain events are more likely to be bought than others. Pinjobs and overturned vehicles, water main breaks, fires, slashing victims, pedestrians struck cars or trains, suicidal individuals on ledges (before or after jumping), people who have barricaded themselves inside structures, preferably with hostages. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s just another guy shot in the Bronx, it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna make the news. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a teenager, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a child, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a baby shot, that kind of stuff\xe2\x80\x94or multiple people shot,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they want.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, most happenings are ordinary and not worth the gas to film. A collision can be a simple fender-bender. A severed limb can mean a finger. Despite the idiom, where there\xe2\x80\x99s smoke, there is not necessarily fire. Reports of burglars breaking in through the roof of an apartment building turn out to be the sound of rain.AdvertisementThe radio crackles again. It\xe2\x80\x99s too far, so he records the string of information as a voice message when the SOD dispatcher repeats it, passing the tip to the 10 or so members of the NYC911News Whatsapp group, who, like Adam, all have some secondary line of work: a DJ, a real estate agent, a bike messenger, and a conservationist to name a few. There\xe2\x80\x99s strength in numbers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say I\xe2\x80\x99m in Bay Ridge and my guy\xe2\x80\x99s in the Bronx and there\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-alarm fire. By the time I get to that 2-alarm fire, that fire\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be out,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can get there, catch the flames, catch the victims being loaded on the ambulance. And if that sells for say, 500 bucks? Multiple stations? At least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a quarter of that, whereas [if] he was a random stringer, I\xe2\x80\x99d be getting nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d In exchange for his cut, Adam handles pitching, vendor accounts, and the other nuts and bolts of NYC911News.As small a community as New York City stringers are, a young and informal an operation like NYC911News is still vulnerable. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of these guys, I notice, are older. When they get a solid staff job at a newspaper like the Daily News or the New York Post they stick with it and they do not quit,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells me, \xe2\x80\x9cThe young guys you might see might be Stringr app users, they might be new grads working at NY1 or channel 12.\xe2\x80\x9d While he feels photographers are different enough from videographers like himself, app-based paid platforms like Stringr and unpaid ones like Citizen eat away at his profits. \xe2\x80\x9cAt some point I would tell people \xe2\x80\x98Hey is that Citizen? Can you stop filming? You\xe2\x80\x99re costing me money,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d though his new approach is to try to recruit videographers using these apps with the promise of better pay. At some point during the evening it becomes clear he uses Stringr too\xe2\x80\x94but passes on the job because it\xe2\x80\x99s in Jersey City.AdvertisementMan being arrested outside the Buccaneer Diner.Photo:\nBryan Menegus (Gizmodo)After a false start chasing a reported assault on the Grand Central Parkway, Adam hears a local precinct responding to an unconfirmed fight: ten people brawling with knives. We arrive at 93rd and Astoria Boulevard in time to watch over a dozen officers lead a single angry man out of the 24-hour Buccaneer Diner into one of the eight cars that responded to the call, no knives in sight. \xe2\x80\x9cI love these perp walks,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam laughs, reviewing the footage. It probably won\xe2\x80\x99t sell either but, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s probably gonna make good social media stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether or not news outlets buy his footage, he can still make a little extra by uploading it to YouTube.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a controversial practice, but contained at least the veneer of assisting people in need. \xe2\x80\x9cIn EMS we had a cool phrase: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything bad to happen to you, but I want to be there when it does.\xe2\x80\x99 What do we say? We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a cool saying like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells me in a moment of reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cComing from EMS to this job is very almost\xe2\x80\xa6 awkward. As an EMT, I work with fire, I work with police, we work together. There\xe2\x80\x99s that camaraderie. Bond. Whatever.

The kiosk is one of several along Jackson Avenue, the majority of which are in the Court Square and Queens Plaza areas.\nAnother two kiosks were installed on 11th Street, the first two on that strip. One of the kiosks is on 45th Avenue, across the street from John F. Murray Playground. The other is on 44th Drive.\nA spokesperson for LinkNYC said the new kiosks were installed about a month ago, and should go live in weeks time.\nLinkNYC launched in 2016 as a way to replace obsolete phone booths with a free, public Wi-Fi network. The kiosks also allow users to make free phone calls, charge their phones, and access maps and city services. Roughly 1,400 kiosks are active citywide, with the first batch of 11 kiosks installed through Long Island City last year.\nVisit LinkNYC for a map of the kiosks citywide.\nemail the author: [email\xc2\xa0protected]\n13 Comments\nGreg Thrasher March 25th, 2018\nI love the entire enterprise\xe2\x80\xa6.Extremely functional and the potential is unlimited.\nReply\nso frustrating March 9th, 2018\nyet another addition that is spending tax dollars on \xe2\x80\x9cinnovation\xe2\x80\x9d before spending tax dollars to fix what we already have. bonus, this innovation attracts perverts!

in download speeds over 500Mbps in our testing.\nBy\nSascha Segan\nMarch 5, 2018 11:14AM EST\nMarch 5, 2018\nPCMag reviews products independently, but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. Terms of use.\nT-Mobile is now boosting LTE download speeds to over 500Mbps by using Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) in New York City, according to Milan Milanovic, Technical Evangelist for Ookla.\nThis is the first time we\'ve actually been able to see and test commercial LAA in the US. The technology, which we\'ve heard a lot about for a year now, pipes 4G LTE signals over unused 5GHz Wi-Fi channels to widen a carrier\'s available bandwidth. For carriers other than Sprint, LAA will be critical to achieving gigabit LTE speeds, because they don\'t have enough contiguous licensed spectrum to achieve those speeds.\nWireless carriers hate referring to these channels as Wi-Fi spectrum, because it implies that Wi-Fi has preferred usage of the 5GHz band when it\'s actually open to everyone. But Wi-Fi is the predominant use for it right now.\nAT&T is working with LAA in Indianapolis and Austin, and Verizon is probably "deploying but being stealthy," Milanovic said.\nAt a cell site at 45th St. and Third Avenue in Manhattan, T-Mobile is combining 20MHz of its Band 4 spectrum with 60MHz of LAA spectrum. Phones connect to the cell site and send data up using the 1700MHz/2100Mhz Band 4 spectrum, and then get downloaded data via a combination of Band 4 and LAA.\nThose speeds are insane. In 13 tests, we got an average of 503Mbps down and 42.7Mbps up. Just to compare, in Ookla\'s Speedtest Intelligence database, the top 10 percent of T-Mobile download speeds in that ZIP code are only around 70Mbps down.\nLAA-capable phones can get up to ten 100Mbps download streams on this cell site, with four on the licensed spectrum (4x4 MIMO) and two on each of three channels of LAA spectrum, Milanovic said.\nOther users on this cell site will do well, but not as well as LAA users, Milanovic notes. The site is also equipped with T-Mobile\'s workhorse Band 2 and the low-frequency Band 12, which penetrates inside buildings.\nLAA is only a solution for dense urban areas, though. This cell site has a coverage diameter of about four blocks (a bit over 1,000 feet), which is considered pretty good for LAA. That\'s a little better than what the coverage probably would be if the site was sending down 5GHz Wi-Fi, and it\'s a little better than New York\'s LinkNYC public Wi-Fi posts.\nRelated\nExclusive: Qualcomm\'s iPhone X Still Outpaces Intel\'s\nExclusive: Qualcomm\'s iPhone X Still Outpaces Intel\'s\nA nearby LinkNYC post doesn\'t appear to be interfering with the T-Mobile signal, Milanovic said. That\'s good news, because one of the concerns about LAA is whether or not it will coexist well with powerful public Wi-Fi.\nYou\'ll need the right phone to hit these speeds, and that\'s not an iPhone. Currently, LAA is supported by T-Mobile\'s Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8, Galaxy S8 Active, Galaxy S9/S9+, LG V30, and the unlocked Huawei Mate 10 Pro. We\'ll make sure to test LAA when we go on the road with our Fastest Mobile Networks drive tests this spring.\nDisclosure: Ookla and PCMag share a parent company, Ziff Davis.\nTop\nRecommended\nRead More\nLyft Partners With Allscripts to Help Patients Get a Ride to the Doctor\nNews & Analysis\nLyft Partners With Allscripts to Help Patients Get a Ride to the Doctor\nSkyroam Wants to Be Your Global ISP\nNews & Analysis Skyroam Wants to Be Your Global ISP\nAbout the Author\nSascha Segan\nLead Analyst, Mobile\nTwitter\nEmail\nPCMag.com\'s lead mobile analyst, Sascha Segan, has reviewed hundreds of smartphones, tablets and other gadgets in more than 13 years with PCMag.

The partnership will allow MCNY to highlight its current exhibit, Beyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics.\nStarting today, the city\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC kiosks will feature images of notable women from MCNY\xe2\x80\x99s exhibit, across all five boroughs. The partnership will last through the end of the month, and highlight the roles of women both well known and others whose work has not attracted mainstream attention prior to the exhibit.\nJust some of the women that will be featured in this digital exhibit include Verina Morton Jones, a physician and leader of the Equal Suffrage League, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the leading figures of the early women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage movement, and Mabel Lee, one of the lesser known activists of the movement.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe perfect match between Link\xe2\x80\x99s platform and our content will bring the story of women\xe2\x80\x99s activism in New York to life in unprecedented ways and make the inspiring history of Beyond Suffrage accessible for even more New Yorkers, tourists, and visitors,\xe2\x80\x9d said the president of the MCNY, Whitney Donhauser, in a statement.\nNext Up In\nNYC Museums\nAmerican Museum of Natural History finally breaks ground on long-planned expansion\nWorld Trade Center memorial for those with 9/11-related illnesses debuts in lower Manhattan\nBrooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s cash-strapped Weeksville Heritage Center surpasses fundraising goal\nBrooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Weeksville Heritage Center launches crowdfunding campaign to stay open\nStatue of Liberty will ban tour guides from some of its most popular areas\nAmerican Museum of Natural History clears final legal hurdle for planned expansion\nMost Read\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nThe apartment where the late rapper grew up is up for grabs\nWhat $1M buys in NYC right now\nFive apartments, five NYC neighborhoods\nWilliamsburg\xe2\x80\x99s quirky shipping container house lists for $5.5M\nThe home on a corner lot is made up of 21 shipping containers meticulously pieced together\nBrooklyn lawmaker wants to resurrect Triboro rail line\nThe rail line would connect the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn\nLovely Ditmas Park townhouse with a huge pool asks $2M\nThe landmarked Brooklyn home has a ton of "old world charm."\nSign up for the\nCurbed NY Newsletter\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 16.

photographer Diane Arbus in New York in the 1960s.CreditCreditRoz Kelly/Michael Ochs Archives, via Getty ImagesBy Jonathan\nWolfe and Alexandra S. LevineMarch 12, 2018Updated, 7:35 a.m.Good morning on this spotty Monday.The New York Times, as part of a new project called Overlooked, has published obituaries for 15 extraordinary women who were not given one at the time of their deaths.Among the first group of women are a few whose remarkable accomplishments took place here in New York.Diane Arbus, a photographer, grew up in luxurious uptown apartments, but she sought inspiration among the city\xe2\x80\x99s outcasts and eccentrics. Her photographs like \xe2\x80\x9cA Jewish giant at home with his parents, in the Bronx, N.Y., 1970\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cA young man in curlers at home on West 20th Street, N.Y.C.\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cGirl with a cigar in Washington Square Park, N.Y.C.\xe2\x80\x9d are debated among photographers as both sublime and exploitative. She influenced generations of photographers and artists including Stanley Kubrick, who adapted her image of twins in his film \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shining.\xe2\x80\x9dThe transgender pioneer, prostitute and drag queen Marsha P. Johnson moved to New York with $15 and a bag of clothes, where she created her alternate persona, Black Marsha. She played important roles in the gay liberation movement and the Stonewall uprising, and she was a fixture of gay life in Greenwich Village, where she was known as the mayor of Christopher Street.Nella Larsen, a writer, became a star of the Harlem Renaissance with her novels \xe2\x80\x9cQuicksand\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPassing.\xe2\x80\x9d Forgotten for years, she was rediscovered in the late 20th century and is now taught in literature classes across the country.Emily Warren Roebling oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. After her husband (and the bridge\xe2\x80\x99s chief engineer) fell ill, she taught herself engineering and took over his duties.What is definitively known about Mary Ewing Outerbridge is that she set up the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first tennis courts, on Staten Island. What we think we know about Ms. Outerbridge is that she played the first game of tennis in the United States, against her sister Laura. What is still unknown is who, exactly, won that match.The Overlooked project will continue to add overdue obituaries to The Times\xe2\x80\x99s pages each week. But New York has more extraordinary women in its history than could fit into a newspaper.Some of them will be featured on LinkNYC kiosks this month, including Mable Lee, a jazz tap dancer and singer; Sarah J. S. Tompkins Garnet, the first African-American female principal of a New York public school; and Verina Morton Jones, the first woman licensed to practice medicine in Mississippi.And to learn about women who wielded political influence in the city, visit the exhibition \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics\xe2\x80\x9d at the Museum of the City of New York.Here\xe2\x80\x99s what else is happening:WeatherToday will be mediocre at best.It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a cold and cloudy Monday, with a high around 40.

Soon after, during the Great Depression, the group held its inaugural citywide cookie sale. And today, a century later, nearly 28,000 young female leaders in New York continue their training in business ethics, environmental conservation, scientific research and more.Ms. Low now figures in a debate to wipe the name of former Gov. Eugene Talmadge of Georgia, a segregationist with white supremacist views, off a bridge in Savannah: Girl Scouts there are rallying to replace his name with Ms. Low\xe2\x80\x99s.New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.For updates throughout the day, like us on Facebook.What would you like to see here to start your day?

It also works with touch-screens and interactive kiosks, and will also enable more location- and time-specific ads, allowing advertisers to send specific messages to a line, station, and individual display.\nIntersection will upgrade its system in Chicago and add 138 new screens to Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) stations over the next two years, eventually hitting a total of 400 displays across the city.\nThe company, which has contracts with Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Dallas,\nwill expand the new IxNConnect system to Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s SEPTA and New Jersey Transit next.\nThis roll out shows the importance of these public-private partnerships for funding technological upgrades for U.S. mass transit systems, as well as the increased market for contextual, location-aware advertising.\nIntersection is backed in part by an investment from Google\xe2\x80\x99s Sidewalk Labs, the smart city firm set to help create a new neighborhood in Toronto to serve as a test-bed for new technology. The company believes that more context-specific ads can help \xe2\x80\x9credeem the credibility\xe2\x80\x9d of outdoor urban advertising.\nThe CTA has been an Intersection partner since 2010. According to Mike Gwinn, director of revenue and fare systems at the CTA, IxNConnect will allow CTA operators to target alerts and emergency messages to individual screens and stations, as opposed to sending messages to an entire route.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrands want to be relevant, and real-time transit information gets commuters to pay attention and look up,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott Goldsmith, president of cities and transit at Intersection,\nGoldsmith says it\xe2\x80\x99s all about generating more advertising revenue for transit authorities, by helping deliver more real-time advertising opportunities for brands. For example, a previous Intersection campaign in New York allowed MillerCoors to display beer ads to subway riders facing a train delay, and point to bars near the closest station.\nNext Up In\nNews\nOur cities are getting hotter\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s killing people\nCities\xe2\x80\x99 climate plans are wildly underestimating emissions, and what to do about it\nWill this PoMo wonderland in San Diego be saved?\nNew affordable housing bill aims to add 1.9M units nationwide in the next decade\nAir pollution\xe2\x80\x99s invisible toll on our cities\nStar Wars land: An inside look at Disneyland\xe2\x80\x99s immersive new world\nMost Read\nAmazon is selling a $1,200 geodesic dome kit for your backyard\nThe Garden Dome Igloo is a 12-foot dome kit that can work as a backyard retreat, glamping tent, or kids play area.\nDo you hear marbles rolling in your apartment?

The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a determination of no hazard for both of the locations.\nOne of the developments, at 134-37 35 Ave., will rise 211 feet above sea level, around 188 feet above the ground, according to the attorney. The 16-story building will feature residential units, a hotel and a community facility.\nThe other project okayed by CB 7 is the 15-story development at 134-03 35 Ave. The building will be 177 feet above grade or 209 above sea level, Palatnik said. It\xe2\x80\x99ll also feature residential and hotel space.\nAfter stamping its approval on the two projects, the board learned that LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x94 the wireless internet station program that has sidewalk kiosks in much of the city already, replacing pay phone booths \xe2\x80\x94 has some plans for Community District 7.\nRuth Fasoldt, director of external affairs for Intersection \xe2\x80\x94 the company that is installing the LinkNYC Wi-Fi hotspots \xe2\x80\x94 gave the board a presentation.\nThe public Wi-Fi system already has kiosks in parts of Queens and is expanding to the advisory council\xe2\x80\x99s area. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are coming down Northern Boulevard, that is how we are getting to your community board,\xe2\x80\x9d Fasoldt said, adding that kiosks on Main Street and Kissena Boulevard are also planned.\nMembers of the board were given a packet with information in the presentation, as well as a list of sites proposed for kiosk installations where there aren\xe2\x80\x99t pay phones.\nThe list includes sites in Flushing on Main Street, College Point Boulevard, Sanford and Franklin avenues, as well as 33-01 126 St. in Willets Point.\nNo board members said that they were opposed to the LinkNYC rollout in Community District 7, but board Chairman Gene Kelty said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the proposed locations for Main Street, given how busy the commercial strip is with pedestrian traffic.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see people being impeded,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nMore about Government\nYour primer for the Queens DA race 1\nNY makes two major transportation moves 1\nARTICLE: Hotels for sale spark shelter concerns\nComing through: lane on Fresh Pond 2\nAn unlikely race for a seat on the bench 1\nMore about Economy\nARTICLE: Hotels for sale spark shelter concerns\n$92.8 billion budget approved for city 1\nARTICLE: $92.8 billion budget approved for city\nCrossing all the Ts for Bartlett Dairy 1\nARTICLE: Crossing all the Ts for Bartlett Dairy\nDiscuss\nPrint\nPosted in\nNorth/Northeast Queens News\non\nThursday, March 15, 2018 10:30 am.\n| Tags:\nGovernment,\nEconomy\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nSign Up\nPrint comments\nSubmit your news!\nSubmit your news!

Along the way, Villegas scopes out the silver LinkNYC kiosks. These 10-foot-tall, silver monoliths have replaced sidewalk payphones in more than 1,300 locations throughout the five boroughs. The kiosks provide free WiFi and calling functions and allow users to charge their phones.\nRelated Stories\nVoter Advocates Say There\xe2\x80\x99s a Way to Increase TurnoutThese Winning Designs Rethink NYC MediansBoulder City Council Votes to Fund Citywide Broadband NetworkExperimental Theater Pushes Boundaries to Preserve Itself\nVillegas looks to the gleaming, 55-inch screens on either side of the kiosks, seeking new additions to a series of numbered New York City facts, rotating among the paid advertisements, event listings, weather updates and transit alerts. If Villegas, 44, comes across a fact that strikes his fancy, he posts a picture of it on Instagram.\nHis family and friends back in Florida, where he lived before moving to the city in June, now know that there is a superhero supply store in Brooklyn (fact number 139), that New York City gets 15 times more snow than the South Pole each year (fact number 206) and that Martin Hildebrandt opened the United States\xe2\x80\x99 first tattoo business in New York City in 1870 (fact number 304).\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are just things that stop you in your tracks and you go, huh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d Villegas says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to not just see someone selling me a phone plan or a movie trailer. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see just facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the intention of Amanda Giddon, the woman behind the facts. Giddon works at Intersection, the company that manages the LinkNYC kiosks (soon to expand the network to Philadelphia). In addition to their primary functions, the kiosks host advertising and more than 50 other content campaigns, such as news headlines, information on how to sign up for health insurance, a series of comics, and the facts. The ads are on track to generate half a billion dollars in revenue over the next 12 years \xe2\x80\x94 enough to cover the cost of the LinkNYC kiosk services.\nGiddon, 24, grew up in the New York suburbs, and still remembers the sense of awe she felt every time she rode the train thirty minutes into the city \xe2\x80\x94 a feeling she still experiences.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough this work, I\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely re-connected with the city in a new way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her interest in historical New York led her to recently pick up Jennifer Egan\xe2\x80\x99s novel \xe2\x80\x9cManhattan Beach.\xe2\x80\x9d She is eager to try Enoteca Maria, an Italian restaurant in Staten Island that features the cooking of a different grandmother each night. She heard about the restaurant during her fact research.\nGiddon kicked off the NYC Facts campaign in early 2017, right when she started at Intersection. Before then, she\xe2\x80\x99d been working in digital media for almost two years, after graduating from Duke University in 2015.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goal with this campaign is to really make New Yorkers feel like tourists and tourists like New Yorkers,\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe strategy is making [LinkNYC kiosks] a beloved member of the community and making life more enjoyable as people navigate the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs of this writing, Giddon has curated 349 facts and rolls out new ones on a weekly basis. The Intersection communications team gives the facts a quick review before the they go live. What makes a good fact? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that can surprise and delight even the most seasoned New Yorker who\xe2\x80\x99s lived decades in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d says Giddon, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd also can arm consumers with things they want to share with their friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt can be a challenge, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to surprise long-time New Yorkers. Giddon spends a few hours a week fact-hunting, which gives her an opportunity to follow her curiosity. From perusing Broadway.org, she learned that only five of the 40 Broadway theaters are actually on Broadway. According to data from Grow NYC, Greenmarket farmers travel an average of 90 miles between their farm and the city. She found that New Yorkers bite 10 times more people than sharks do worldwide while reading a Time magazine article. When FiveThirtyEight published a report on elevators in New York, the fact that 18 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s adult population could be riding in elevators at a time caught Giddon\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\nA partnership with the National History Museum\xe2\x80\x99s StarTalk Radio resulted in a series of celestial-themed facts. Giddon also worked with the Department of Records to create a series of historical photos displayed on kiosks in the neighborhoods where the photos were originally taken. Her plan to attend the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March inspired a group of facts about women\xe2\x80\x99s history and the suffrage movement in New York, all on display during the event.\nGiddon keeps track of her facts on a spreadsheet and estimates that about two-thirds of the facts in her collection haven\xe2\x80\x99t been published. Sometimes coworkers and friends will suggest facts to include, but Giddon must verify the facts before publishing them. Giddon finds the facts about firsts, such as the origins of the first cappuccino or Manhattan cocktail, to be the most difficult to pin down.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople feel so strongly about New York culture and history that I make it my duty to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the right stuff out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon says with a laugh, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf something is wrong, we totally will get called out on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBecome A Next City Member Today\nSign-up for our newsletters\nSign Up\nSamantha Maldonado is\xc2\xa0a multimedia journalist based in New York City.

The move would advance Mayor de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s goal of bringing \xe2\x80\x9caffordable, reliable, high-speed\xe2\x80\x9d internet to the city by 2025.\nThe initiative is hardly out of the gate: The city has yet to determine if the plan would actually work, let alone how much it would cost to implement. The concept is similar to the LinkNYC kiosks that brought free Wi-Fi and public charging outlets to city sidewalks.\nIn November 2017, the mayor issued a request for information to internet service providers and related fields seeking ideas on how access to high-speed, affordable internet can be increased in the coming decade. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether the idea to harness the city\xe2\x80\x99s streetlights is related, but Curbed has reached out to City Hall for clarification.\nThis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time the city\xe2\x80\x99s streetlights have been used for telecom equipment. About 6,400 poles are already used or reserved by private companies, and a few streetlights throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn are already rigged up with free city Wi-Fi.\nThe move to diversify access to high-speed public Wi-Fi would be one more step in the city\xe2\x80\x99s agenda to combat the grip a select few telecom companies have on the city\xe2\x80\x99s access to Wi-Fi. A source of the Post\xe2\x80\x99s said the city is hoping the Wi-Fi will compete with Verizon, who Mayor de Blasio has had a long-standing beef with.

The concept is part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s push to give every city resident access to affordable high-speed internet, and it would theoretically compete with the likes of Verizon and Spectrum.\nThe streetlight initiative follows up on\xc2\xa0the relatively new LinkNYC kiosks, which allow members of the public free access to\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi, phone charging ports and the ability to make phone calls on a speakerphone loud enough to wake up an entire block. It is unclear whether or not the expanded\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi will be free for all, but it comes in a period when New York is seeing a rapid expansion of its wireless services in public spaces.\xc2\xa0Earlier this month, a pair of companies, Transit Wireless and\xc2\xa0Alcatel-Lucent, were recognized in the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s Genius Transit Challenge for their plans to\xc2\xa0install an LTE network throughout the subway system\xe2\x80\x94not just at platforms.\nThe technology required to bring\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi to streetlights is nothing new. Companies have been\xc2\xa0producing concepts for streetlights as part of the Internet of Things for years.\xc2\xa0But\xc2\xa0the backing of De Blasio to roll out a public\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi option in New York could be a game changer not only for the city but for the country as a whole.\nThe city is already working to phase out its old high-pressure sodium lamps (which give off that iconic orange glow) for brighter, whiter LED lights. Throw\xc2\xa0free or\xc2\xa0cheap wireless internet into the mix, and you could see New Yorkers\xc2\xa0get more excited about new\xc2\xa0streetlights than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in decades.\nSign up to receive great Time Out deals in your inbox each day.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising\nShare\nTweet\nStaff writer\nBy Clayton Guse\nClayton is a digital editor for\xc2\xa0Time Out New York.

Reporter Anna Sanders writes that the city \xe2\x80\x9cwants to turn streetlights into high-speed public Wi-Fi hotspots as part of a plan to boost Internet access across all five boroughs.\xe2\x80\x9dIt would be an interesting idea! Using existing infrastructure for new technologies makes a lot more sense than trying to build a completely new one. We reported on something similar\xc2\xa0last month down in Park Slope, where Councilman Brad Lander has convinced the city and LinkNYC to use the WiFi kiosks planted all over the city to also show the waiting time for buses along the B63 route.NYC wants to turn streetlights into public WiFi hotspots. Exclusive from me: https://t.co/jaEmsbJDG3\xe2\x80\x94 Anna Sanders (@AnnaESanders) March 18, 2018The idea of using streetlights could also work for deploying 5G technology in the city. One of 5G\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges is how comparatively weak the signals are. Even though they are capable of transmitting way more data, they can\xe2\x80\x99t go through thick walls and geographical features the way the sturdier, current 4G cellular and WiFi wavelengths do.One idea is to simply broadcast from more places in dense cities, essentially flooding dense places with signals to overcome their weaknesses. Perhaps this could be a method for that. There has even been talk of the government building a 5G network, the merits of which we reported on last month, as a means of overcoming the difficulties of having private corporations do it. AdvertisementOutgoing New York CTO Miguel Gamino didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to an immediate request for confirmation of this story, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll add that if he does.What would be the challenges such an idea would face? Presumably there would be a bit of regulatory red tape to get though, plus the question of cutting up the sidewalk for trenches if that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to connect the poles, plus questions of legality and rights.The Post article is well worth a full read.

It is also too soon to say what the cost of such an endeavor would mean to taxpayers, as the concept is merely in the preplanning stages and officials are still trying to determine if it would even be possible. If it does go through, the service would be part of a bigger push by Mayor Bill de Blasio, for every city business and resident to have \xe2\x80\x9caffordable, reliable, high-speed\xe2\x80\x9d Internet service by 2025.\nThis plan, if it happens, would take advantage of one of the city\xe2\x80\x99s most widespread and virtually otherwise untapped resources.\nCity spokeswoman Kate Blumm said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe humble light pole is actually one of the city\xe2\x80\x99s most crucial pieces of public infrastructure. We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to explore how this basic street furniture will be part of our 21st-century city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOver 250,000 streetlights exist across the city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs, of which approximately 6,400 are already being used or reserved by private companies for telecom equipment that expands cellular and Web service.\nIn certain Brooklyn and Manhattan neighborhoods, free city Wi-Fi is already installed on many light poles. However, those are only on a small scale and developed independently.\nThe Post reports, \xe2\x80\x9cStreetlights could also be a big moneymaker for the city. Communications companies eagerly put up a few hundred bucks a month to use a single pole already. But proposed federal regulation might hinder the city\xe2\x80\x99s scheme. The Federal Communications Commission has proposed measures that would limit how much control the city has over the streetlights, including the price companies pay to use them. Still, the city believes streetlight Wi-Fi could provide competition for traditional cable and internet providers like Spectrum and Optimum. Ultramodern high-speed 5G service might also be offered from the poles, bypassing companies like AT&T and Verizon. The city particularly hopes to compete with Verizon, said a well-placed source familiar with the project.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBack in 2013, while serving as a public advocate, de Blasio accused Verizon of not bringing its fiber-optic FiOS service to low-income communities. Verizon was actually sued by the city last year for its failure to fulfill its promise to offer all households FiOs service. The litigations are still ongoing, with Verizon insisting it met the requirements set forth by the city contract by running fiber cable by every residence, it just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t connected the cables to each individual home.\nBy Rachel Shapiro\nBy: Rachel Shapiro\nDonate & Support\nClick to comment\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Port Covington in Baltimore, Lake Nona in Orlando, Hudson Yards in New York, and Quayside in Toronto are all examples of neighborhoods being developed, or redeveloped, from the ground up to support the future of urban mobility, connectivity, and livability.The emergence of these forward-thinking neighborhoods represents the next evolution of smart city design and user experience. To build a smart city, you have to start with smart neighborhoods, according to David Gilford, senior director, client strategy at Intersection.Affiliated with Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Sidewalk Labs\xc2\xa0urban innovation group, Intersection develops smart city technologies and digital strategy plans for neighborhoods such as those mentioned above.\xe2\x80\x9cThe smart city label often evokes a vertical, top-down concept proposed by a government in partnership with various corporate interests, and with a central dashboard to control everything,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening in terms of moving the needle, it\xe2\x80\x99s about how we empower individual people and organizations at the neighborhood and community level. It\xe2\x80\x99s really about trying to understand how people use urban spaces from one block to the next.\xe2\x80\x9dIn 2018, the two most well-known innovation conferences in the U.S. launched tracks dedicated to smart cities for the first time. The CES Smart Cities Marketplace in Las Vegas and South by Southwest (SXSW) Cities Summit in Austin suggest that public awareness around the value propositions for more connected, data-driven, resilient, and inclusive urban environments is moving into the mainstream.The reality of delivering on that at a city-wide level, however, is still very much in the baby steps development stage.Today, tech companies such as Alphabet, Siemens, Cisco, Dell, Amazon, Microsoft, Deloitte, Panasonic, and IBM are collaborating with cities to build central dashboards pulling data from many disparate systems to manage daily urban operations more efficiently. That encompasses an endless array of cloud-based technologies leveraging Internet of Things infrastructure, relating to everything from autonomous vehicles to resource management to emergency services.It\xe2\x80\x99s a massive proposition to integrate all of those effectively across an entire city. Neighborhoods, meanwhile, provide a smaller scale to design and develop smart city prototypes more cohesively.For example, Panasonic and the City of Denver are developing the\xc2\xa0Pe\xc3\xb1a Station NEXT\xc2\xa0community near Denver International Airport, built atop \xe2\x80\x9ca smart resource grid with redundant and clean energy and a robust fiber backbone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The 382-acre, transit-oriented development is integrating the same systems used in Panasonic\xe2\x80\x99s Fujisawa Smart Sustainable Town in Japan.In Canada, Sidewalk Labs, Intersection and the City of Toronto are co-creating the new 800-acre\xc2\xa0Sidewalk Toronto district, beginning with the waterfront Quayside development.Dan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, posted on Reddit: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are designing a district in Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern Waterfront to tackle the challenges of urban growth, working in partnership with the tri-government agency Waterfront Toronto and the local community. This joint venture, called Sidewalk Toronto, will blend people-centered urban design with cutting-edge technology to achieve new standards of sustainability, affordability, mobility, and economic opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9dFurthermore, urban neighborhoods and districts are more approachable for integrating smart platforms beyond considerations of just cost and logistics.One, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fuss with numerous stratified municipalities and their varying regulations to get things done. Two, it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to engage a specific community as a distinct focus group to continually test new innovations, source feedback, and reintegrate updated processes.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no cities without neighborhoods, but at the same time, each neighborhood should contribute to the city as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cOur mission is to figure out how technology and the built environment support the needs of citizens in local communities, now and in the future.\xe2\x80\x9dDisney and Carnival Cruise TechTo date, one of the most advanced examples of a fully connected, data-driven urban ecosystem is Disney. The company\xe2\x80\x99s theme parks are showcases for technologically-enhanced UX anchored around the Disney MagicBand. It was the first wearable to scale and deliver personalized audience engagement successfully in a live, yet controlled, public environment.Building on that in 2018, a few of Carnival\xe2\x80\x99s upscale Princess cruise ships are presently rolling out the brand\xe2\x80\x99s new Ocean Medallion guest-centricity platform in phases. Created by the same people who developed Disney\xe2\x80\x99s model, the new onboard IoT infrastructure connects everyone (who opts in) to everything. The wearable medallion represents the future of personalized, on-demand, end-to-end customer journeys orchestrated to increase brand loyalty and lifetime customer value.The hundreds of new video screens placed throughout the Princess ships, for example, recognize the individual party facing them. The devices can then pull up the appropriate personal itinerary and recommend activities during open time slots that align with a specific customer\xe2\x80\x99s travel preference data. That\xe2\x80\x99s just one scenario. Anyone interested in the future of customer experience should watch Carnival CEO Arnold Donald\xe2\x80\x99s keynote at CES 2017.Meaning, the most advanced smart ecosystems today, which will eventually inform the future of urban society and how we ostensibly live together more effectively, are being developed by land and ocean-going theme parks.\xe2\x80\x9cThe places we look for examples of new technology in real-world environments, although they tend to be fairly closed systems, are cruise ships and Disney,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do an excellent job of understanding where people are and what they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to be doing, in a very subtle way. It\xe2\x80\x99s relatively unprecedented where that\xe2\x80\x99s happening on a city scale yet, but the technologies are available because of the work these other environments have done.\xe2\x80\x9dThat said, while the Disney and Carnival models are closed platforms, neighborhoods require open-source technologies to encourage greater community engagement and development.\xe2\x80\x9cA city needs to be responsive to full-time residents versus tourists in a theme park for a few days,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilford says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that means a more open platform where an owner can\xe2\x80\x99t completely control the only technologies that live there. From a city perspective, you want set standards and frameworks as much as possible, but you also have to provide ways for other companies and entrepreneurs to build on top of the platform.\xe2\x80\x9dNext Generation Urban Connectivity PlatformsSo how does the Disney/Carnival platform translate in a neighborhood like South Bronx?One example moving in that direction is Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC program, replacing every phone booth in New York\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs with public Wi-Fi kiosks to provide broadband access to every neighborhood. To date, there are 1,440 kiosks operating, with a total of 7,500 planned, subsidized by advertising displayed in large digital screens on both sides of the 12-foot-high metal slabs.Beyond just Wi-Fi needs, people are also making an average of 200,000 phone calls per month from the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 tablet interface, as well as accessing different types of city and neighborhood information directly from the screens. Moving forward, Intersection is expanding the Link platform to London, Leeds and Philadelphia, with more cities presently in contract development.\xe2\x80\x9cWe were initially surprised how much the kiosks are being used for making phone calls, and we know a large portion of those are visitors, so that has an impact from a travel perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing high usage in neighborhoods like South Bronx that has one of the lower broadband penetration rates in the city\xe2\x80\xa6. People are also connecting to a Link outside a coffee shop, for instance, if it\xe2\x80\x99s faster than the coffee shop Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9dLast December, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth published new research \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cMeasuring the Economic Impact of Smart City Innovations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting that both LinkNYC and CityBike are driving incremental economic growth in neighborhoods where they\xe2\x80\x99re active. Mastercard compared restaurant and retail sales in seven Brooklyn neighborhoods prior to LinkNYC installation and six months after.According to the report, noting that causality can only be assumed: \xe2\x80\x9cWithin six months after a free Wi-Fi kiosk was installed, retailers in the immediate area saw an overall bump in sales of two to three percent.\xe2\x80\x9dAlso, Intersection just launched its new IxNConnect city transit initiative in Chicago this month with the first of 400 planned video screens now operating at train stations and bus terminals. According to Intersection: \xe2\x80\x9cIxNConnect is a new content platform that helps transit agencies better communicate with their customers, enhance the rider experience, and maximize revenue with adjacent advertising.\xe2\x80\x9dThe IxNConnect ecosystem allows transit companies to customize messaging for each screen to provide more timely and location-specific information to passengers, including special events in the neighborhood, nearby system disruptions, wayfinding and direction, and more targeted sponsor messages.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a dashboard interface for transit authorities to be able to monitor, control and push messages in stations depending on the neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilford explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThe information is more context-sensitive and aware of any mobility issues in real time, such as a baseball game in the area or other congestion issues, which can then be used to provide advice on alternate routes.\xe2\x80\x9dFrom Place to PlatformThe above urban tech platforms are just a small sample of emerging innovations, of course, that will further propel the conversation shift around cities from place to platform. CES and SXSW this year highlighted the spectrum of companies investing in technologies with an urban tech application.At SXSW, Bose launched its new audio AR glasses to help people navigate and engage environments in new ways, bridging the physical and virtual worlds.Also, the new Swarm AI platform won the AI and Machine Learning category in the SXSW Interactive Innovation Awards. Swarm AI \xe2\x80\x9cprovides the interfaces and algorithms to enable \xe2\x80\x98human swarms\xe2\x80\x99 to converge online, combining the knowledge, wisdom, insights, and intuitions of diverse groups into a single emergent intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9dSo how does the ability to use machine learning in a neighborhood to \xe2\x80\x9coptimize options,\xe2\x80\x9d as Swarm AI proposes, potentially deliver better, data-driven community planning and decision-making processes and platforms?Or, how could Swarm be paired with Niantic AR technology used in Pokemon Go to create a physical/digital knowledge share ecosystem specific to an individual neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the big question about how we bring these concepts to life,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we use information to better communicate via mobile or digital signage? How do we get the right message to the right person at the right time? That all requires a mix of thinking about how we develop the future of messaging, which includes advertising, in cities to be more contextual. It\xe2\x80\x99s about supporting the messages that cities are trying to get out into the public realm.\xe2\x80\x9dMore and more municipal governments are developing online public forums to accomplish that with open-data and crowdsourcing platforms. Boulder, Colorado just launched its Be Heard Boulder platform this month, featuring a variety of interactive tools including discussion forums, polls, surveys and crowdsource mapping to collect citizen input and data to inform future urban development.Last year, Austin rolled out a similar platform with Speak Up Austin. The City of Austin is using the portal to gather community feedback on specific neighborhood projects, such as the Seaholm Waterfront.Traditionally, cities have been defined by place, both geographical and socio-political.\xc2\xa0How we interpret place informs the specific identity and purpose of our urban centers. Today, however, the definition of place is evolving as a social construct for greater participatory self-determination with connectivity vehicles like those in Boulder and Austin, further driving the evolution\xc2\xa0from place to platform.Designing the Smart NeighborhoodThe next step toward designing and developing a smart neighborhood requires bundling all of these disparate types of technologies and many others into an interoperable ecosystem, and aligning that with the physical design of an individual neighborhood.Interoperability is key, which means, ideally, that every system needs to be aware of what the others are doing in real-time, and be able to adapt to changing information as necessary without human intervention.The challenge is knowing what a smart neighborhood will require in terms of connectivity design and UX in 10 to 20 years. In Manhattan, for example, the World Trade Center Complex in Manhattan and the Hudson Yards neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 the most expensive private development ever in the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 were first conceived before the launch of Facebook and the iPhone.Therefore, neighborhoods today need to be developed as flexible spaces with the ability to evolve in line with new tech innovations. Whereas in the past, \xe2\x80\x9cGovernments and urban planners were used to building a user interface for the physical world,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Max Oglesbee, head of client strategy, Intersection Technology.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to run conduit, not cables, so we can adapt systems more easily without ripping up streets and tearing down walls,\xe2\x80\x9d Oglesbee adds. \xe2\x80\x9cWith buildings, you\xe2\x80\x99re investing in them maybe every one, two or three decades. In contrast, visitors and locals in New York change technologies, often with no friction and at zero cost, almost every day.\xe2\x80\x9dThat makes it difficult to design buildings today, which in five years, for example, might require drone delivery portals on each floor, or landing pads for autonomous flying cars, or VR-enabled community, meeting and game-ified spaces.\xe2\x80\x9cSo what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do at Intersection is build integrations between building systems and consumer technology,\xe2\x80\x9d says Oglesbee. \xe2\x80\x9cThat way, neighborhoods are a platform upon which the developer can build systems for local residents and visitors that are scalable and adaptable.\xe2\x80\x9dThe new 235-acre, post-industrial Port Covington development in Baltimore embraces that philosophy. Like many other inner urban areas across America, Port Covington was cut off from its neighboring communities by an interstate highway system built in the mid-1900s. Eventually, the neighborhood fell into decline, even though it has 2.5 miles of prime waterfront.Now, the Sagamore Development Company, with investors including Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, is stewarding the redevelopment of the district into a smart neighborhood, anchored by Under Armour\xe2\x80\x99s new headquarters. Intersection is working with Sagamore to translate Under Armour\xe2\x80\x99s mission of connected fitness into connected urban living, much like the Equinox fitness company is attempting to do in Hudson Yards.According to Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Communities Practice, which helped inform the Port Covington Digital Master Plan: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time, real estate owners and operators have the opportunity to deliver seamless, coordinated experiences across complex physical environments\xe2\x80\xa6 by connecting physical and digital assets to maximize partnerships, assets and revenue.\xe2\x80\x9dTo deliver on that, Intersection focuses on five themes: ubiquitous connectivity, coordinated transportation, accessible recreation, dynamic wayfinding, and intelligent occupancy.\xe2\x80\x9cThe urban design and digital strategies focus on connecting Port Covington physically and virtually to the larger city,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s paramount that people, both locals and visitors, move freely between Port Covington and the rest of Baltimore.\xe2\x80\x9dMayors Get ItDuring the SXSW Cities Summit this year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors hosted the\xc2\xa0Civic I/O\xc2\xa0event in partnership with SXSW and Austin Mayor Steve Adler. Sessions focused on smart urban development, such as the\xc2\xa0Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Matchup: Tech Innovation Pitch Competition\xc2\xa0for startups working in urban tech. The top three finalists were Biobot Analytics, Citymart and Elucd.More than 20 mayors participated in Civic I/O sessions like\xc2\xa0Agile Activism: Big Change Starts at City Hall\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Primed for Amazon: Value & Cost of HQ2 for Cities.During the former, South Bend Mayor\xc2\xa0Pete Buttigieg discussed his city\xe2\x80\x99s successful 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days initiative to identify and address urban blight caused by abandoned homes. To kickstart the program, his office posted a running account online designed to show how many of the 1,000 homes had been upgraded or demolished during the 1,000-day timeline.Buttigieg said the reason the initiative worked was because the city developed an online crowdsourcing portal, and it engaged the community as both a participating workforce and a watchdog group. By being transparent publicly, and opening a community dialogue, that put pressure on the city to perform.\xe2\x80\x9cMy team and I knew that if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t make our goal, there was going to be a very visible, very public failure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buttigieg. \xe2\x80\x9cIt created a kind of vulnerability on our part, and propulsion to go the extra mile, and do things we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done before, and try novel things just to make it happen. So there are interesting ways you can publicize your goals, and publicize where you are.\xe2\x80\x9dBig change does start at city hall, and many of the mayors at SXSW said they\xe2\x80\x99re collaborating together more intentionally, on a global scale, to share best practices and case studies such as Mayor Buttigieg\xe2\x80\x99s.Many agreed that the catalyst behind that shift toward greater collaboration is the lack of any meaningful national commitment toward addressing the barrage of challenges facing cities today.\xe2\x80\x9cAt South by Southwest, thanks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors programming, you could really feel the presence of city leaders throughout the conference more so than ever before,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gilford. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the absence of federal leadership, cities have taken things upon themselves to be the place where the rubber meets the road, and it\xe2\x80\x99s in these innovative neighborhoods where you really see that happening.\xe2\x80\x9dFurther ReadingThe Power of \xe2\x80\x98Networked Governance\xe2\x80\x99 to Solve City ProblemsBuilding a City like a SmartphoneThese 6 Technologies Are Redefining the \xe2\x80\x98Smart City\xe2\x80\x99A Smarter Smart CityNew District in Toronto Will Tackle the Challenges of Urban GrowthAugmented and Virtual Reality Beyond the 21st CenturyThe above content was produced by the branded content SkiftX team for the upcoming Skift Cities platform, defining how cities are connecting visitors and locals to co-create the future of urban UX.

It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult not to brag, though, when you\xe2\x80\x99re awarded the title of \xe2\x80\x9csecond city of tech,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe best U.S. city for female founders.\xe2\x80\x9d While unofficial, these kudos prove just how far the city has come, and just how much growing we will continue to do.\nFlash back to 2008: A handful of neighborhoods in Northern California were rapidly congealing into what we know today as Silicon Valley. While companies like Google and Microsoft already loomed large as tech giants, with cool office spaces and handfuls of employee perks, many young innovators were getting the idea to form companies of their own.\nDespite the West Coast building up its own tech culture, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before NYC became an essential piece of the U.S. tech ecosystem. Companies realized New York City served not only to connect them with the East Coast, but important markets in Europe. Furthermore, New York was already home to a wealth of flourishing industries: food, fashion, real estate and more.\nBy the time the 2010s rolled around, big tech was making its move on the Big Apple. In 2010, Google purchased one of the largest tech office properties in all of New York City. In 2012, Facebook opened their first engineering office outside of California in Downtown Manhattan.\nStill, these companies were only getting a piece of the magic established by NYC-based tech companies like Etsy, Bloomberg, BuzzFeed and more. Many of tech offices concentrated themselves in Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea neighborhood, establishing the nickname \xe2\x80\x9cSilicon Alley.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the last five years, New York City has emerged from the shadow of other tech capitals and established a tech style all its own. Innovation flourishes at City Hall, which has helped bring WiFi to all MTA train stations, and installed smart LinkNYC kiosks throughout the city. The many prestigious colleges and universities scattered throughout the five boroughs have re-emphasized their computer science and engineering programs to produce top talent for the booming workforce \xe2\x80\x94 a 2015 donation of $100 million helped put NYU\xe2\x80\x99s Tandon School of Engineering back on the map, for example. Academic incubators like Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Startup Lab have also helped foster new enterprise.\nNow, new tech companies don\xe2\x80\x99t see New York as an offsite for their businesses, but as a headquarters. According to statistics gathered by the city, New York has added a staggering 76,000 tech jobs in the last ten years alone. Comparatively, New York completely blows other blooming tech scenes out of the water (Boston, the East Coast city with the second most jobs added, only saw an addition of 36,000 jobs). These numbers are staggering even by citywide standards \xe2\x80\x94 while NYC\xe2\x80\x99s overall job economy grew 16 percent in the last ten years, tech alone boomed at more than 30 percent growth.\nEven more exciting is the fact that New York has added a wealth of tech jobs in both technology and non-technology sectors. B2B, e-commerce, and healthtech proved to be some of the biggest growth sectors for tech companies in the city. This points to the growing pattern of New York City emerging from the shadow of Silicon Valley and becoming a smart city all its own.\nLooking ahead, New York City is poised to continue its technological growth from both a business and cultural standpoint. New jobs continue to be added, and new companies look to the city as a home for their future businesses. Ten years from now, one can only assume New York City\xe2\x80\x99s tech scene will be even bigger and brighter than it is today.\nBloomberg\nView profile\nFollow\nNYC startup guides\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Companies to Work for in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Software Engineer Jobs in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDECoolest Tech Offices in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Sales Jobs in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Benefits at NYC Tech Companies\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Data Analyst & Data Science Jobs in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Design Jobs in NYC\nView\nLOCAL\nGUIDEBest Marketing Jobs in NYC\nView\nLoad More\nFind your dream jobDeveloper JobsView 798 jobsDesign + UX JobsView 171 jobsMarketing JobsView 290 jobsProduct JobsView 199 jobsSales JobsView 474 jobsData JobsView 276 jobsView all NYC jobs\nBuilt in Chicago\nUnited We Tech\nBuilt In NYC is the online community\nfor NYC startups and tech companies.\nFind startup jobs, tech news and events.\nBuilt In.

They\'ve already replaced thousands of traditional telephone booths across New York City and the United Kingdom.\nLinks\xc2\xa0also come with three cameras, which the firm says will record passersby to discourage vandalism, and which users could activate for video calls. Intersection\xc2\xa0is also testing environmental sensors in New York that could be used to track air quality and traffic.\nLinkNYC\nClose up of the tablets that Intersection installed in New York. The Philadelphia version might be a little different.\nSupporters see these kiosks as just one facet of the communications technology that will build future "smart" cities. A Link, they say, can share news and information within neighborhoods, guide tourists, and help close the digital divide.\nBut privacy advocates say they worry about giving so much power and personal data to a private firm that\'s less accountable than city governments.\nEighty of the initial 100 kiosks will be placed in Center City and University City. The goal, said Ruth Fasoldt, a spokeswoman for the New York-based Intersection, is to "build corridors of WiFi\xc2\xa0for a person to be able to walk down a given street and to be connected to the WiFi\xc2\xa0for however many blocks."\nThe city and Intersection are to evenly split the advertising revenue \xe2\x80\x94 which should pay for the kiosks and then some. Philadelphia\xc2\xa0is guaranteed at least $450,000 annually, but officials could give no estimate for the ad revenue, since the location of each Link hasn\'t been determined.\nLessons learned\nIn New York and abroad, the rollout hasn\'t always been smooth.\nNotably, the kiosk providers had to drop a key feature \xe2\x80\x94 web browsing \xe2\x80\x94 once they realized that it was X-rated content that users were watching. No web browsing will be offered in\xc2\xa0Philadelphia, just apps that send users to specific sites.\nLast year, vision-assistance tools were added after the National Federation of the Blind sued New York City and the Link program, arguing that the kiosk tablets lacked basic accessibility features such as speech synthesizing.\nIn Philadelphia, the push for such kiosks first began in 2014 after Titan, a transit advertising firm, won a 20-year contract from the city. Titan has since merged with another firm to form Intersection, whose investors include Alphabet\'s Sidewalk Labs.\nIn New York City, where more than 1,400 kiosks have been installed, there are\xc2\xa0plans for at least 6,000 more. The city estimates earning about $540 million in advertising revenue by 2026.\nNew York critics\nIn March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union criticized LinkNYC for being unclear about the user information that would be retained.\nAt a New York hacking conference that summer, Benjamin Dean, a technology policy analyst, cautioned those who might view the kiosks as merely a public and free WiFi\xc2\xa0service.\n"As we know," he said, "when you\'re not paying, you\'re not the customer \xe2\x80\x94 you\'re the product."\nTwo citizen privacy groups concerned about LinkNYC, called ReThinkLink and NYC Privacy, sprang from that conference. A fringe group that has also seized on the issue is Cryptome, which maintains a controversial website that claimed to have published the identity of the CIA analyst who found Osama bin Laden.\nThe group has been video recording crews as they install the kiosks and posting the videos online.\n\xe2\x80\x98We are the users\xe2\x80\x99\nIntersection says police and other government agencies have made "valid" requests\xc2\xa0for kiosk data only eight times \xe2\x80\x94 and it provided information after only two of those requests, both in 2017.\nThe firm also says it does not keep video records for more than seven days, and that it does not track user viewing histories. Only some cameras are turned on, though LinkNYC would not specify how many. Fasoldt said that the camera\xc2\xa0footage is primarily used to investigate damage to the devices. Recently, "we had a garbage truck back into a Link," she said.\nPhiladelphia has not yet released its privacy policy, but Mike Dunn, spokesman for the Office of\xc2\xa0Transportation and Infrastructure, says that will happen before the first kiosk is installed.\xc2\xa0 The city\xc2\xa0has also adopted New York\'s Internet of Things guidelines on how municipalities can responsibly use technology. In a 2006 referendum, Philadelphia residents approved the use of public surveillance cameras.\nLinkNYC\'s\xc2\xa0tweaked privacy policy, which the local ACLU chapter has praised, says personal information won\'t be shared with other companies or third parties beyond those hired to help it provide services. LinkNYC also commited to not using facial recognition technology, and that it "will not use our cameras to track you throughout the city."\n"We are trying to be extremely transparent," said Fasoldt. "We have an office in Philadelphia and an office in New York. We are the users, and we want to protect ourselves and our friends."\nFasoldt said that Intersection wants to work with residents on the privacy policy, but observed that "not only do your phones know more about you, but so does the bodega across the street."\nAmul Kalia, an analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit, said that cities working with Links need to build a way for people to have a voice in the process.\n"The city\'s priority is to be able to say, \'Hey, we\xc2\xa0brought you internet.\' Intersection\'s is to be making money," Kalia said. "People also need to seriously ask the question if they\'re OK with being recorded as they\'re walking down the street."\nPosted:\xc2\xa0March 28, 2018 - 5:00 AM\nRebecca Heilweil, STAFF WRITER\nNewsletters\nGet the news you need to start your day\nSign Up Inquirer Morning Newsletter\nNever Miss a Story\nSubscribe\nWe Recommend\nExplosions rip through South Philadelphia refinery, triggering major fire and injuring 5\nJoseph A.

Foote on March 28, 2018March 28, 2018\nGrowing concerns about climate change, pollution, and energy costs have prompted new paradigms of consumption and sustainability to crystallize. In response to evolving concerns, a number of countries and large cities have focused on the development of Smart Cities and Smart Grids, using technology to support an infrastructure managed by Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics.\nSmart Cities\nCities and their surrounding urban areas take up three percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s land surface but provide sixty-eighty percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas emissions. Cities consume seventy-five percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources and eighty percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s global energy supply. More efficient cities would be a benefit to mankind, and less damaging to the planet.\nSmart Cities offer their citizens a high quality of life with minimal consumption of energy resources. This is accomplished by way of intelligent interconnections within the infrastructure (electricity, heat, transportation, communications, and Smart Buildings) sharing Big Data. Technological advances such as low-cost Cloud storage and the Internet of Things (IoT), combined with inexpensive sensors, have allowed smart cities to track huge amounts of information ranging from gunshots to air pollution to traffic. Also, smartphone apps allow both citizens and city workers, to monitor problems and send feedback to city hall.\nThe Swiss Federal Office of Energy, for example, initiated a pilot program titled Smart City Switzerland in 2012. They brought together representatives from business, public administration, and universities to rethink the urban environment. Smart City Switzerland currently has over sixty projects underway way and supports new scientific partnerships and innovation.\nNew York City has also taken steps to become a Smart City. New York City was recognized for its initiative, Building a Smart & Equitable City. One example of this initiative in practice is the use of sensors to control air pollution caused by the burning of heavy fuel oils in buildings.\nBig Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Clean Energy\nBig Data is transforming the energy industry as a whole, making it more flexible and efficient by coordinating wind and solar energy with traditional energy sources. Networks of sensors can be installed to detect changes in weather and wind speeds. These sensors combined with Big Data \xe2\x80\x93 and a few useful algorithms \xe2\x80\x93 can:\nHelp develop more efficient methods for harnessing renewable energy, such as the improvement of solar panel or wind turbine locations.\nHelp predict weather patterns and the energy needed for human comfort during that weather so energy companies can generate enough electricity during peak demand and lower production as demand comes down.\nIdentify and educate wasteful consumers regarding efficient energy consumption.\nBringing Artificial Intelligence into the mix can:\nAllow for communication with smart thermostats to coordinate demand on overextended energy grids.\nUse power line sensors to identify areas with changing energy needs.\nDeal with power fluctuations, solar flares, cyberattacks, and other disruptions.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is supporting a new project, called the Grid Resilience and Intelligence Project (GRIP). On Sept 12, 2017, the project was granted $6 million for three years of research. GRIP is the first project to use AI to help electrical grids deal with problems. The project will develop algorithms to learn about electrical grids by studying smart meter data, and peripheral information, such as satellite and street-view imagery and electric vehicle charging data.\nSmart Grids\nSerious concerns about the environmental damage caused by coal-fired power stations and the potential hazards of nuclear power have prompted demand for renewable energy. However, solar and wind power are highly variable and provide intermittent power levels, at best. Both energy sources rely on weather patterns that cannot be controlled. A Smart Grid solves this problem by taking excess electricity from where it is not being used and sending it to areas needing it.\nSudden \xe2\x80\x9csurges of electricity\xe2\x80\x9d from alternative sources can also be a problem. At present, a grid is designed to handle a steady power level and could run into major problems if it suddenly received large surges of electricity from outside sources. A cloudy day that suddenly becomes clear could produce a surge of electricity. A sudden gust of wind could do the same thing. A surge of electricity can burn out a fuse in the power line system or easily damage electrical generators running at a constant speed, causing traditional power facilities (specifically, coal plants) to run much less efficiently.\nPerhaps the most important feature of the Smart Grid is the matching of supply and demand, which is called load balancing, and prevents electrical surge damage to the generators. Algorithms designed to collect and process Smart Grid data have been developed and are currently being improved upon. The need for sophisticated control systems has become obvious, and Smart Grids are the solution.\nMicrogrids\nMicrogrids coordinate with the existing electrical systems and network infrastructure and can feed electricity back to the main grid if it is suffering a power outage. A microgrid is typically a small community or corporate energy system, normally made up of solar panels or wind turbines, and independent from the main electrical grid. The main purpose of a microgrid is to provide communities with reliable, affordable energy. Benefits include reducing greenhouse gas emissions and cutting electrical costs for local residents.\nIn Brooklyn, a startup called LO3 Energy, is coordinating with Siemens Digital Grid to test a new microgrid system. Members of the neighborhood with and without solar panels are buying and selling electricity to one another. They use a Blockchain platform which documents each transaction automatically. Also, should city electricity go down, this isolated network can operate self-sufficiently, providing the local community with power. LO3 plans to incorporate a system of batteries throughout the grid, to keep the lights on during storm-related emergencies.\nSmart City Case Studies\nZurich\nZurich, Switzerland, holds the title of Most Sustainable City in the World. It was at the top of the Arcadis 2016 Sustainable Cities Index, which compared Zurich\xe2\x80\x99s public transit system, financial industry, and high quality of life to other large cities around the world. Zurich receives financial support for its Smart City initiatives from Switzerland, which is a member of the ERA-NET Smart Cities and Communities (ENSCC), along with eleven other European countries. ENSCC goals include improving and developing:\nThe use of Big Data and Smart Data\nSmart, integrated urban transport systems\nSmart, integrated urban energy-efficient systems\nSmart tools for integrated transport and energy-efficient systems\nSmart governance with smart citizens\nSmart building management systems have become a reality in Zurich. In the fall of 2015, interconnected electrical, cooling, and heating systems regulated and controlled by an intelligent management system were installed in a number buildings, including the Swisscom building. This resulted in a significant drop in CO2 emissions and provided living spaces which were more harmonious with the natural environment.\nIn the southern part of Zurich, a sustainable living area is being developed. It is called Greencity- Zurich. One of the goals for this section of the city is residents using less than 2000 watts per day by 2050 without lowering the standard of living. Residential and commercial buildings are powered by rooftop solar panels supplemented by a small hydroelectric power plant. A mixture of shopping, living space, and offices are planned, complete with schools, day care centers, and facilities for senior citizens.\nThe energy used by Greencity-Zurich is taken completely from 100% renewable sources, with approximately 70% of its electricity generated by local, roof-mounted solar panels and other alternative sources. A Smart Grid is used to control the generation, distribution, and storage of electricity. Surplus electricity is used for electric vehicles or stored to meet future needs. Zurich\xe2\x80\x99s power plant has agreed to supply renewable energy to the Greencity for heating and cooling using a system of geothermal probes and groundwater wells.\nNew York City\nNew York City was named the Best Smart City of 2016 during the Smart City Expo World Congress held in Spain. Recognition was given to the city\xe2\x80\x99s Building a Smart & Equitable City initiative, developed by the city\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Technology and Innovation. The initiative promotes the use of the Internet of Things while promoting cybersecurity.\nThese are some examples of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s efforts at becoming a Smart City:\nLinkNYC uses the city\xe2\x80\x99s payphones to create a network providing public Wi-Fi, device charging stations, and phone calls. In the process, New York City created the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network. At present, hundreds of thousands of people have used the new Wi-Fi system well over 50 million times.\nUrban Tech NYC is a program offering over 100,000 square feet of reasonably priced space and equipment for entrepreneurs to develop smart and sustainable solutions in the areas of waste, energy, transportation, water, and agriculture.\n$18.6 million has been invested in a connected-vehicle pilot program, coordinated with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nJeff Merritt, a director at the Office of Technology and Innovation, stated:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen used effectively, IoT devices, like sensors that capture pollution in the air or lights that only turn on when someone is in the room, can produce cost savings, bolster civic engagement, and strengthen public health and safety. As cities move into the future, municipal leaders must also be cognizant of, and actively mitigate, the challenges and risks raised by these technologies, most notably in areas of public privacy and security.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPhoto Credit: TierneyMJ/Shutterstock.com\nSearch the Site\nSearch for:\nDATAVERSITY CommunityAdvertisement\nFeatured Online Training \xe2\x80\x93 Data LeadershipMORE FROM DATAVERSITYData Architecture Summit\nChicago, IL\nOctober 14-17, 2019\nLearn More\nDG Vision\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 9-12, 2019\nLearn More\nFollow Us\nDATAVERSITY.net\nTDAN.com\nDMRADIO.biz\nConferences\nEnterprise Data World\nData Governance & Info Quality\nData Architecture Summit\nOnline Conferences\nEnterprise Data Governance Online\nData Architecture Online\nEnterprise Analytics Online\nDATAVERSITY Resources\nDATAVERSITY Community\nWhite Papers\nWhat is\xe2\x80\xa6?\nConcept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN)\nCompany Information\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nContact Us\nPress Room\nZivan Ori\nNewsletters\nDATAVERSITY Weekly\nDATAVERSITY Community Weekly\nTDAN.com\nDM Radio Weekly\nDATAVERSITY Education\nData Conferences\nTrade Journal\nOnline Training\nUpcoming Live Webinars\n\xc2\xa9 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 2019 DATAVERSITY Education, LLC | All Rights Reserved.\nCookies SettingsTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use technologies such as cookies to understand how you use our site and to provide a better user experience.\nThis includes personalizing content, using analytics and improving site operations.\nWe may share your information about your use of our site with third parties in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nYou can change your cookie settings as described here at any time, but parts of our site may not function correctly without them.\nBy continuing to use our site, you agree that we can save cookies on your device, unless you have disabled cookies.\nI Accept', b"Mayor de Blasio Announces NYC Secure First Ever Cybersecurity Initiative From Harlem To Hollis\nMenu\nTop Menu\nHarlem World Magazine\nHarlem World Magazine is the #1 source in the world for living your best life and style in Harlem.\nMenu\nPrimary menu\nHome\nBeauty\nBooks\nCalendar\nCelebrity\nEducation\nEvents\nFilm\nHistory\nMusic\nReal Estate\nArchitecture\nSports\nStyle\nContributors\nCassandra\nCC Minton\nClaude Jay\nDiane Alford\nDontre Conerly\nEartha Watts-Hicks\nHosea Johnson\nKyle Fraser\nLil Nickelson\nMarc Rasbury\nMichael Andre Adams\xe2\x80\x99\nNicky Mayers\nReggie Jones\nRudy Collins\nSeitu Oronde\nTod Roulette\nUdo Salters\nWalter Rutledge\nYolande Brener\nFood\nArt\nReal Estate\nLife\nStyle\nSign-Up\nPartners\nAtlanta\nHampton\xe2\x80\x99s\nLos Angeles\nWashington DC\nAbout Us\nAdvertising Services\nCalendar\nPodcast\nSubmit A Story\nTips\nHarlem World Advisory Board\nHarlem Media Group\nThe Best\nThe Best On A Budget\nThe Best Culture & Attractions\nThe Best Food\nThe Best For Kids\nThe Best Nightlife\nThe Best Pet Services\nThe Best Places To Stay\nThe Best Shopping\nThe Best Wellness\nShop\nThe Harlem World Collection\nDonate\nSecondary menu\nPost navigation\n\xe2\x86\x90 Previous\nNext \xe2\x86\x92\nMayor de Blasio Announces NYC Secure First Ever Cybersecurity Initiative From Harlem To Hollis\nPosted on 03/29/2018\nby\nHarlem World Magazine\n\xe2\x80\x94\nLeave a reply\nMayor de Blasio today announced the launch of NYC Secure, a pioneering cybersecurity initiative aimed at protecting New Yorkers online. Using a steadily evolving suite of solutions, NYC Secure will defend New Yorkers from malicious cyber activity on mobile devices, across public Wi-Fi networks, and beyond. The first NYC Secure programs will include a free City-sponsored smartphone protection app that, when installed, will issue warnings to users when suspicious activity is detected on their mobile devices. The City additionally announced new world-class protection for its public Wi-Fi networks, becoming the first city in the world to provide such services to all residents and visitors free of charge.\nNYC Cyber Command (NYC3), which leads the City of New York\xe2\x80\x99s cyber defense efforts, is overseeing the development and implementation of NYC Secure. Created in 2017 by Executive Order, NYC Cyber Command directs citywide cyber defense and incident response, mitigates cyber threats, and provides guidance to the Mayor and City agencies. Using the latest technologies and leveraging public-private partnerships, NYC Cyber Command works across more than 100 agencies and offices to protect, detect, respond, and recover from threats while setting citywide information security policies and standards.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur streets are already the safest of any big city in the country \xe2\x80\x93 now we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing that same commitment to protecting New Yorkers into cyberspace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mayor de Blasio. \xe2\x80\x9cNew Yorkers manage so much of their lives online, from paying bills to applying for jobs to engaging with government. NYC Secure will ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re applying the best and most effective protection efforts to help New Yorkers defend themselves online.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to stay a step ahead of cyber criminals that are continuously finding new ways to hack devices, we must invest in the safety of the digital lives of our residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoff Brown, Citywide Chief Information Security Officer and Head of NYC Cyber Command. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile no individual is immune to cybersecurity threats, this program will add an extra layer of security to personal devices that often house a huge amount of sensitive data.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute Mayor de Blasio for NYC Secure. The City of New York has long been a progressive model for the nation in providing services for its people. Now, through his innovative leadership in cybersecurity, Bill has placed New York at the forefront of great cities in an area of national urgency. I salute Mayor de Blasio and his administration for this important cybersecurity initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeh Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security.\nThe City\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to get a free smartphone protection app into the hands of the public is in response to a dramatic increase in the use of mobile phones to connect to the internet. In early 2017, mobile phones accounted for 50% of web traffic, and the average U.S. user spends over 5 hours a day on their smartphone. Despite this significant growth in use, most mobile phones remain vulnerable to hackers. Gartner estimates that by 2020, 30% of all cyberattacks will be mobile-based.\nThe app, which will be available free to all New Yorkers this summer, will help minimize these risks by identifying malicious attacks and warning users of attempts to compromise their device. Users will receive recommended steps to protect themselves, such as disconnecting from a malicious Wi-Fi network, navigating away from a compromised website, or uninstalling a malicious app. The app will not take actions on the phone by itself.\nThe City-sponsored app will equip mobile devices with the technology needed to analyze threats while operating under a strict privacy policy and layers of technical controls that ensure user privacy is respected. The app works without accessing any personally identifiable information, and will not collect or transmit any private data. Similar technology available commercially typically checks for threats by collecting data from a mobile device and analyzing it externally in the cloud\xe2\x80\x93meaning users must sacrifice the privacy of their data to secure their devices. That is not the case with the City-sponsored application.\nThe City will additionally strengthen its own Wi-Fi networks by implementing a new layer of security. This innovative technology will protect users browsing the Internet on City guest wireless networks from downloading malicious software such as ransomware, or accessing phishing websites that attempt to trick users into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. The technology defends browsing sessions without using or storing any personally identifiable information, while adhering to the highest standards of user privacy.\nNYC Cyber Command has mandated the deployment of the technology across all \xe2\x80\x9cGuest\xe2\x80\x9d and public Wi-Fi networks provided by New York City agencies and related entities by the end of the year. Eighteen agencies and offices are already utilizing the protection for their internal networks, and the remainder of internal networks will implement it by the end of 2018. The technology will also be deployed on the LinkNYC network, which already has 1,400 free wi-fi Kiosks around the five boroughs and millions of users.\nThe City will be actively soliciting feedback during this process. For more information on NYC Secure, please visit secure.nyc.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNYC Secure delivers a world-class cybersecurity upgrade to New Yorkers and all who use our City\xe2\x80\x99s expanding public WiFi network,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2015, I joined with the City of London Police and Center for Internet Security to found the non-profit Global Cyber Alliance (GCA), which co-developed the Quad9 technology being adopted today. We are delighted to see the work of GCA and its partners integrated into groundbreaking programs like NYC Secure, which will expand the reach of safe-browsing technology and protect millions of residents and visitors alike. I commend Mayor de Blasio and his administration for its proactive and collaborative approach to combat the rising tide of cybercrime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe commend NYC for launching this program and including Quad9 as part of it to protect New Yorkers from malicious websites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Kavany, Chief Operating Officer of the Global Cyber Alliance. \xe2\x80\x9cQuad9 was developed for the public good to provide security while at the same time preserving users privacy. New York City\xe2\x80\x99s action to protect users of the public WiFi system is a bench mark achievement that will guide other jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs hackers ramp up attacks on mobile devices and mobile networks, we must create cultures of security in the public sphere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher Young, CEO of cybersecurity company McAfee. \xe2\x80\x9cInitiatives like this one in New York City will help grow awareness of the increasing cyberattack problem and may urge citizens to take more action to protect themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe online environment is powerful and useful but it is also becoming hazardous. Attention to safety and security is vital and Google is completely committed to working with New York City to provide safe and secure communications for all its citizens. This is a shared responsibility and we will do our part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vint Cerf, Chief Internet Evangelist.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCyber breaches and cybercrimes deeply affect the livelihoods of millions of people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jamie Dimon, Chairman & CEO, JPMorgan Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a growing concern, which is why JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to protecting our clients and customers. We applaud Mayor de Blasio and the City of New York for helping empower New Yorkers to protect themselves from the increasing risk of cyber threats.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMark McLaughlin, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said, \xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is a responsibility we all must take seriously. At Palo Alto Networks, we are committed to making the Internet safer for everyone. We applaud NYC Cyber Command for leading this effort on behalf of one of the greatest cities in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cCyberCrime is sadly a part of our daily reality, and NYU Tandon is eager to continue its partnership with New York City and support Mayor de Blasio\xe2\x80\x98s initiatives that help provide online privacy and security,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nasir Memon, Associate Dean at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.\nDmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike Co-founder & CTO, said \xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Crowdstrike is committed to making the Internet safer. We commend NYC Cyber Command for its leadership on this important issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStaten Island District Attorney Michael E. McMahon said, \xe2\x80\x9cThreats to cyber security can put all New Yorkers at risk and often lead to stolen information, identity theft or other serious financial crimes. The City\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone protection app helps safeguard mobile devices to prevent private data from falling into the wrong hands, and I commend Mayor de Blasio for making this technology widely available.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecent events have made clear the need for keeping personal online information as secure as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d U.S. Representative Eliot Engel said. \xe2\x80\x9cCyber threats are real and we cannot continue to be flat-footed when it comes to responding to them. I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased the City is taking a proactive approach to helping residents keep their information safe, and I applaud Mayor de Blasio for implementing this robust cybersecurity strategy. But we must continue doing more at all levels of government, which is why I am pushing for the implementation of greater protections at the federal level. Together, we can make strong progress toward protecting ourselves from one of the most serious threats of our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nU.S. Representative Joe Crowley, Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said \xe2\x80\x9cAs breaches of personal data have become more and more common, we must innovate new ways to protect New Yorkers. NYC Secure is a preemptive security measure, one that will help New Yorkers avoid malicious attacks before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate Mayor de Blasio and the NYC Government on the launch of NYC Secure, the city\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever cybersecurity initiative that will protect New Yorkers online. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, I have been a strong advocate for enhanced cybersecurity protections for all consumers, especially those living in New York City. I look forward to working with the Mayor and NYC Government on issues such as cybersecurity, privacy and encryption to prepare our communities for the 21st century,\xe2\x80\x9d said U.S. Representative Yvette Clarke.\nU.S. Representative Dan Donovan said, \xe2\x80\x9cWith its ironclad privacy protections, I support the City\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to help secure personal information. The cyber threat is constantly evolving, and government, private industry, and users need to have the tools to keep pace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is essential to our efforts to protect online networks, voting systems, and even our democracy. I am proud to have supported legislation to authorize more than $1 billion in federal grants to help New York and states replace outdated technology and train employees in cybersecurity to ensure personal private data remains secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cTechnology is vital to our continued success and innovation. We have witnessed what happens when our cyber infrastructure and digital security come under attack, from threats at home and abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said U.S. Representative Adriano Espaillat. \xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is essential to our efforts to protect online networks, voting systems, and even our democracy. I am proud to have supported legislation to authorize more than $1 billion in federal grants to help New York and states replace outdated technology and train employees in cybersecurity to ensure personal private data remains secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\nState Senator Brad Hoylman said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe amount of personal information available and easily stolen from our smart phones \xe2\x80\x93 which we are all entirely dependent on \xe2\x80\x93 is staggering and requires robust security measures. My State Senate District is home to many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading tech companies and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud this groundbreaking initiative is kicking off right here at Civic Hall. I commend Mayor de Blasio for this action to keep New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 most sensitive data secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs New York City continues to grow and become more technology friendly cyber security is one of the many vital aspects that need protection. NYC Secure is a great tool to protect and secure the information of New Yorkers. No one should have to worry about their information being invaded by hackers. By using this approach the city can help decrease unwanted cyber-attacks and provide a better quality of life for all New Yorkers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Assembly Member Clyde Vanel, Chair of the Assembly Subcommittee on Internet and New Technology.\nCouncil Member Koo, Chair of the Committee on Technology said, \xe2\x80\x9cSafeguarding the privacy and security of our city\xe2\x80\x99s public Wi-Fi networks is increasingly important as we move toward making it easier and more accessible for all New Yorkers to go online. NYC Secure will allow the public to enjoy the full extent of NYC\xe2\x80\x99s online universe with the confidence that our systems are designed to protect and defend their personal information. Many thanks to Mayor de Blasio for making sure NYC\xe2\x80\x99s Internet is always one step ahead of those who engage in cyber attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the NYPD is focusing on cyber intelligence and counterterrorism threats, the city must do its part to support their efforts by protecting every New Yorker and visitor from potential attacks through their phone or any public WiFi,\xe2\x80\x9d said Council Member Donovan Richards, Chair of the Committee on Public Safety. \xe2\x80\x9cAs technology advances, so do the criminals, which is why NYC Secure is critical to the safety of all private citizens. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank Mayor de Blasio, the NYPD and the NYC Cyber Command for all their efforts to keep New York City safe and secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to see New York City step into the forefront of cyber security by protecting not only local government and businesses but also residents throughout the five boroughs via a new convenient and free app,\xe2\x80\x9d said Council Member Ben Kallos. \xe2\x80\x9cNew York City is the center of the universe and for that reason alone our city and its residents are targets of scams like phishing, ransomware and identity theft. NYC Secure will give New Yorkers a much needed added layer of protection on their mobile devices. Thank you to Mayor de Blasio for having the foresight and courage to invest time and resources in this initiative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to Mayor de Blasio for launching this innovative initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Council Member Kalman Yeger. \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Secure will provide New Yorkers with an unprecedented free service to protect mobile device users from cyberattacks. With an ever-growing number of New Yorkers who only have internet access through a mobile device, NYC Secure is yet another way the City is stepping up to protect us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSign-Up for Constant Contact e-mail marketing!\nHarlem World Magazine, relies on its readers for support.

City officials plan to launch a free smartphone app this summer that will alert users to "suspicious activity" on their phones, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. The app will send a notification whenever it senses something fishy and tell users how to combat it by uninstalling a dangerous app, navigating away from a webpage or taking other steps, said Geoff Brown, the city\'s chief information security officer. The app aims to protect everyday New Yorkers from online threats as the average American spends five hours a day on a smartphone, city officials said. Mobile devices now account for half of all web traffic, and 30 percent of all cyberattacks are estimated to be mobile-based by 2020, officials said. "I don\'t think it really matters if you do a lot online or a little online \xe2\x80\x94 everyone should be worried at this point," de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference Thursday. "And if we can do something that will help everyday people protect themselves, I think that\'s all to the good." The app is part of the city\'s new "NYC Secure" initiative to bolster digital security amid a growing specter of online threats. As another piece of the initiative, the New York City Cyber Command, which oversees the city\'s digital defenses, will require all city agencies and other entities to install additional security on their public and "guest" WiFi networks by the end of the year. The city is rolling out a system called Quad9 that bars users from accessing malicious websites or software on those networks, Brown said Eighteen agencies and offices have already safeguarded their networks, and the 1,400 LinkNYC kiosks that provide free WiFi around the city will also be protected eventually, officials said. De Blasio did not detail other pieces of the "NYC Secure" initiative, but said it will "start quickly and it will build out." The entire program will cost about $5 million a year to run, de Blasio said. The city wants to give New Yorkers added security without compromising their privacy, Brown said. The app, for example, won\'t require any personal information and won\'t send data off of users\' phones, he said. The rollout of the city\'s programs follow the widely reported Russian interference in the 2016 elections using several digital means. It also comes in the wake of revelations about two weeks ago that Cambridge Analytica, a firm tied to President Donald Trump\'s campaign, mined data from Facebook for over 50 million users, leading to intense criticism of the social media company.\nData breaches that affected billions of accounts have hit other large companies such as Yahoo and Equifax, the credit reporting agency. The city has taken up several efforts to protect its own digital infrastructure in recent years, the mayor said, but officials want to help protect the public absent significant action from private companies.\n"The good news is smartphones put the world at our fingertips, but they also put private info and data at the fingertips of thieves and we need to do something to protect our people," de Blasio said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica mined Facebook data. The revelations came about two weeks ago.

But despite industry skepticism -- and often outright antagonism -- a new crop of city executives is re-examining their role in broadband deployments.\nWhy? First, the national discussion around smart cities has evolved. It\'s not just about putting sensors on street lights and adding cameras to intersections anymore. There is growing recognition that network infrastructure is critical for enabling smart city initiatives at scale, and with that understanding has come the logical deduction that owning and/or controlling network assets is valuable.\n"Infrastructure is the yellow brick road" for smart cities, says David Graham, deputy COO for the city of San Diego, who spoke this week at the Smart Cities Connect Conference & Expo in Kansas City.\nAnd for the first time at this annual event, that sentiment was echoed by a significant number of city and technology leaders now working to implement smart city strategies.\nSecond, while most cities recognize that they can\'t do everything on their own, they\'re also becoming more aware of where they do have leverage with the private sector, as well as the potential consequences of not setting ground rules with partners today before the Internet of Things takes over.\nA good example of this is the city of San Francisco. Mayor Mark Farrell has announced a new "Fiber for SF" initiative with the goal of getting fiber broadband to every home and business, and making free WiFi available in public spaces. According to Farrell, a team of folks from the city has been working behind the scenes on this project for four years, and after much research, he and his cohorts have decided that they want to create a public/private partnership\nto achieve their aims. However, a key tenet of that partnership will be that the city must own its network infrastructure.\n"This is really what people wanted: publicly owned from day one; [an] open access network," says Farrell. And, "We want net neutrality back. We want consumer privacy protections."\nFarrell says the plan is to sign a contract with a partner to run lit and dark fiber network services in the city for 15 years, all with provisions in place related to net neutrality, privacy, security and equity. That partner will build and operate a gigabit-speed fiber network, and then lease it out to retail service providers, earning a guaranteed percentage of the revenue generated.\nSo far, the city of San Francisco has released a Request for Qualifications regarding the project, and it is right now processing responses to that RFQ from potential partners. The hope is that the city will be able to draft a concrete proposal in the near future that it can put to voters for budget approval in November. If approval is granted, the city will then move to a Request for Proposal (RFP) process.\n"In terms of owning the asset itself... to me it\'s critically important that the public owns it, especially as you think about the revenue opportunities down the road," says Farrell.\nBut he adds, "To be clear, we\'re going to have a large opposition campaign from the telcos... And we\'re ready for it."\nPictured from left to right: IDC VP Ruthbea Yesner, Kansas City CIO Bob Bennett, New York CIO Samir Saini, San Diego Deputy COO David Graham and Aurora CIO Michael Pegues\nAnother example of network infrastructure leadership is coming from New York City. While CTO Miguel Gami\xc3\xb1o, who has helped manage several projects including the LinkNYC kiosk rollout, is getting ready to leave his position, Samir Saini, the former CIO of Atlanta, has just relocated to New York as DoITT Commissioner and CIO.\nSaini not only brings a wealth of expertise with him, but he\'s also gaining authority in his new NYC role with direct oversight of the city\'s telecom franchise agreements. Those franchise agreements are where the rubber meets the road for network infrastructure, and Saini is clear that he will pursue arrangements designed to make sure all of the city\'s residents benefit over the long term.\n"The infrastructure stuff is not sexy, but it is really important," says Saini. "And I think the core foundational component to any city being a smart city, and however you want to define that, is a connected city. So it\'s that basic foundational broadband access for everybody in your city. It\'s the equitable and affordable distribution of high-speed broadband on every street, in every home, in every public facility across our cities."\nYou\'re invited to attend Light Reading\xc2\x92s Big Communications Event\n-- the ONE event that delivers fresh perspective on the rapid transformation of the telecom industry and the road ahead. We\'ll see you May 14-16 in Austin -- communications service providers get in free!\nIn the latest wave of municipal interest in broadband network infrastructure, there is general consensus that cities and commercial operators are going to have to find new ways to partner. While a few communities are taking broadband entirely into their own hands, most are actively seeking help from the private sector, recognizing that particularly as the smart city movement gains momentum, local governments aren\'t best suited to handle the complexity of network operations and the rapid pace of technology change.\nNetwork operators also seem to be coming to terms with the idea that they have to court communities if they want to form successful partnerships and put themselves in a position to make serious money from smart cities.\nAt the Smart Cities Connect event, service providers showed up in force this year, with AT&T Inc.\n(NYSE: T) and Sprint Corp.\n(NYSE: S) acting as sponsors, and Charter Communications Inc. , Cox Communications Inc.\nand Verizon Communications Inc.\n(NYSE: VZ) all making the rounds at panels and keynote sessions. These operators want to open a dialog with cities, and in many cases have already begun that process.\nAs the conversation continues, they\'ll just have to make sure not to underestimate the will of the current class of city leaders, or how informed and strategic about network infrastructure they are starting to become.\nRelated posts:\nComcast, Cox Go Big on IoT, Smart Cities\nLas Vegas Bets on a New Network Edge\nPole Control Fight Gets Net Neutrality Nasty\nAT&T\'s Smart City Ambitions Take Root\nVerizon Takes \'One Fiber\' to More Cities\n\xe2\x80\x94 Mari Silbey, Senior Editor, Light Reading\nLike what we have to say?

Due to the lack of expertise at the city or town level, and the capital needed to provide the services, it would almost seem a given that plan is not going to work in many cases.\nReply \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Post Message \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Messages List \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Start a Board\nLogin50%50%\nJoe Stanganelli,\nUser Rank: Light Sabre3/30/2018 | 5:46:36 PM\nRe: Interesting stuff\n> "Breaking apart bundles of fiber is exactly what the Trump DoJ required CenturyLink to do when it merged with Level3."You mean selling them off, right (like the interests in Idaho, for example)?

Certain traffic must be prioritized. Otherwise you\'ve got critical infrastructure facing downtime, drones crashing, and other catastrophes while Johnny Hipster tries re-binging Black Mirror.\nReply \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Post Message \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Messages List \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Start a Board\nLogin50%50%\nClifton K Morris,\nUser Rank: Light Sabre3/30/2018 | 3:10:44 PM\nInteresting stuff\nWhen it comes to smart cities, there definitely quite a few out there. However, how about \xc2\x93smart states\xc2\x93. For example, in this world community of Delta-Montrose,\nin rural Colorado, a broadband network award was awarded to a smaller start up.\nWhen the local ILEC, Centurylink, found out about this, they made a tender offer to buy the company out including the award and funding using \xc2\x93First Right Of Refusal\xc2\x94\nWhen legislatures found out about this award and subsequent change of hands of lining CenturyLink\xc2\x92s pocketbooks (funds were likely used to finance additional mergers), State Legislature passed a bill that requires FROR-based transactions to provide similar services at a lower price to the customer.\nThis change to FROR helps to ensure that good-faith negotiations occur and funding made available goes to ensure the services which people make taxpayer dollars available to purchase actually become available.\nChanges like these can also enable and allow Verizon or AT&T to build high speed data networks in areas where a local incumbent Baby Bell struggled to gain approvals or simply didn\xc2\x92t want to build because it had negotiated to a clause which allows it to still accept municipal broadband funding but offset the affected population of customers in another area.\nSee:\nhttps://durangoherald.com/articles/215479-colorado-rural-broadband-gets-help-on-two-fronts-general-assembly-and-congress Building broadband infrastructure can be relatively easier if cities and towns build their own fiber in the right-of-way, then lease it to carriers on a per-fiber optic strand basis instead of wholesale-selling of right-of-way rights to the highest bidder.\nBreaking apart bundles of fiber is exactly what the Trump DoJ required CenturyLink to do when it merged with Level3.\nIt\xc2\x92s a solution that solves many issues if cities and municipalities also look to installing their own bundles of 24,46,or even 128 strands as part of any upgrade or new roads or transportation project.\nIndeed, it was the DoJ realized the existing business model which included exclusive, in perpetuity sale of right-of-way rights instead of individual fiber strands placed companies at a disadvantage in the long term. Instead, new taxpayer-funded fiber should be laid whenever roads are expanded, paved, or large road infrastructure projects occur.\nThen from there, with inexpensive solutions from BaiCells things become easier and manageable.\nToday\xc2\x92s BaiCells even has a solar-powered LTE base station with a range between 8-10 miles that can run for 24-48hours (at full load) with only 4 hours of of sun to charge the battery.\nOf course, BaiCells could be mounted on a light pole, but solar is free and requires less electrical engineering work. Low-voltage solutions require one less sign-off.See:\nhttps://na.baicells.com/2017/10/30/baicells-technologies-releases-first-solar-powered-small-cells-product/\nReply \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Post Message \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Messages List \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Start a Board\nEducational Resources\nsponsor supplied content\nOperator Strategies for 5G Transport: 2019 Heavy Reading Survey\nHeavy Reading White Paper and Verizon Case Study:\nTDM-to-IP/MPLS Migration with Circuit Emulation (CEM)\neBook: Building the World\xc2\x92s First Fully Virtualized Network - How Rakuten Mobile is Doing it\nUse Case: Get Your Competitive Operational Edge from the Cloud\nWhite Paper: The Four Pillars of Service Edge Transformation\nEducational Resources Archive\nFeatured Video\nFlash Poll\nAll Polls\nUpcoming Live Events\nNetwork Virtualization & SDN Americas\nSeptember 17-19, 2019, Dallas, Texas\nCable Next-Gen Breakfast Series @ SCTE\xc2\x92s Cable-Tec Expo\nOctober 1-2, 2019, New Orleans, Louisiana\n5G Transport & the Edge\nOctober 10, 2019, New York, New York\n5G Network & Service Strategies @ MWC19 Los Angeles\nOctober 22, 2019, Los Angeles, CA\nSoftware-Driven Operations\nNovember 5, 2019, London, England\nGlobal Telecoms Awards\nNovember 7, 2019, London, UK\nCable Next-Gen Business Strategies\nDecember 3, 2019, New York, New York\n2020 Vision Executive Summit\nDecember 3-5, 2019, Vienna, Austria\nCable Next Gen-Technologies & Strategies\nMarch 16-18, 2020, Embassy Suites, Denver, Colorado\nBig 5G Event\nMay 18-20, 2020, Irving Convention Center, Dallas, TX\nAll Upcoming Live Events\nUpcoming Webinars\nJune 26, 2019\nHow Cable Can Profit From the New Video Streaming Wars\nJune 27, 2019\nNCTC Webinar Series: Playing Smart in the Smart Home Market\nJuly 18, 2019\nBracing for the 5G Era\nJuly 23, 2019\nDo You Really Understand Your Subscriber Usage Patterns?\nAnalytics to the Rescue!\nAugust 15, 2019\nDeploying Next Generation Passive Optical Networks\nSeptember 19, 2019\nBringing HDR video to Life\nOctober 17, 2019\nAutomating the Cable Network\nNovember 14, 2019\nSecuring the Cable Network\nDecember 12, 2019\nVirtualizing the Cable Architecture\nWebinar Archive\nPartner Perspectives - content from our sponsors\nAdaptive MIMO in the Era of 6GHz Wi-Fi\nBy James C.

NYC Cyber Command will oversee the initiative.\nAs part of the program, the city will launch a free smartphone protection app \xe2\x80\x94 available to all New Yorkers in summer of 2018 \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0that will send warnings to users when malicious activity is detected on the device, as well as recommendations for self-protection, such as disconnecting from a dangerous Wi-Fi network.\nThe city will also add technology to its public Wi-Fi networks to boost security by protecting users from downloading ransomware or accessing phishing websites. These security measures will be added by the end of the year, and will also be deployed across the city\'s LinkNYC network.\nDive Insight:\nThe city\'s focus on mobile devices is driven by the increased use of smartphones and Wi-Fi enabled applications across the nation. The city reports that, in early 2017, mobile phones accounted for 50% of web traffic and by 2020, 30% of all cyberattacks will be mobile-based, according to Gartner.\xc2\xa0"The amount of personal information available and easily stolen from our smart phones \xe2\x80\x94 which we are all entirely dependent on \xe2\x80\x94 is staggering and requires robust security measures," said New York State Senator Brad Hoylman in a statement commending Mayor de Blasio on the effort.\nHolyman was joined by officials from various levels of government, as well as private sector companies such as McAfee, JPMorgan Chase, Palo Alto Networks,\xc2\xa0CrowdStrike and F-Secure, to praise de Blasio\'s actions on information security standards.\nThis announcement comes just days after Atlanta fell victim to a ransomware attack that caused outages across a number of city departments, and Baltimore fell victim to a hack that shut down the city\'s 911 dispatch system. Both attacks raised overall concerns about the vulnerabilities of cities\' operational and emergency systems, and brought into question some cities\' current measures to combat cyberattacks.\xc2\xa0By being proactive on cybersecurity, New York City \xe2\x80\x94 which is often the target of attacks, both physical and cyber \xe2\x80\x94 is demonstrating the various ways it can increase resident protection.\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s our job in government to make sure that people are safe online. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new reality,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio told Reuters. And while many cities have not yet faced this reality head-on, it is crucial that cybersecurity becomes more of a priority in all local governments for the sake of public trust, data protection and operational efficiency.\nRecommended Reading:\nReuters\nNew York offers free cyber security tools to public to deter hackers\nSmart Cities Dive\nInside the mind of Silicon Valley\'s chief privacy officer\nFollow\nKristin Musulin\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nGovernance\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nOffice of the Mayor\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Smart Cities Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nSmart Cities Dive\nTopics covered: energy, green building, transportation, waste solutions, connectivity, policy and more.\nDaily\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

Here are just a few examples of the Olympics\xe2\x80\x99 technology moments, gathered from my inbox. \xe2\x80\x93Cynthia Wisehart\nEAW Adaptive System\nThe Medals Plaza stage within the PyeongChang Olympic Plaza hosted cultural performances and video displays of the competition during the day and Olympic medal ceremonies in the evening. Playback for these important events at this iconic location was reinforced by an Eastern Acoustic Works (EAW) Adaptive System provided by Seoul-based Dasan SR.\nThe one-floor Medal Plaza \xe2\x80\x93 at 1,267 square meters in size \xe2\x80\x93 features a wide, domed stage and an audience area wider than it is deep. The challenge, EAW says, was to blanket the outdoor area with clean, high-quality sound while providing the flexibility required for the different forms of entertainment.\nTo accomplish this, Dasan SR specified left-right columns of four Anna modules hung above the stage video screens (covered by scrim to match the dome). Large scaffolding towers were erected further left and right of the stage for the main PA, which was made up of 20 Anya modules. Two columns of five Anya modules hang in each scaffold.\nA combination of twelve Otto subwoofers \xe2\x80\x93 ground stacked 2 x 3 \xe2\x80\x93 located under each Anya array along with four SB1002 subs placed under the stage provide the low end that the programming demands. Six KF730 enclosures were placed along the lip of the stage for front fill while 16\xc2\xa0MicroWedge stage monitors were on hand for the artists.\nK-ARRAY Python\nGangneung Ice Arena served as the venue for both the figure skating and short track speed skating competitions. The arena houses two 60m x 30m ice rinks for competition and training respectively, and has a seating capacity of 12,000.\nBecause the arena reaches four floors aboveground in height, Olympic organizers needed an audio system that was precise and powerful for both the audience and the figure skaters performing to music.\nOrganizers asked South Korean distributors, Soundus to supply an audio design and specification that would provide the necessary breadth and accuracy. Their design included K-Array PythonKP52 line arrays, chosen for clarity and definition and an ability to provide continuous, even coverage that reaches the last bleacher in the stands.\nEquipped with Pure Array Technology (PAT), the Python has no crossover points in the voice range and no reflex ports. Only the closely-spaced, full-range 3\xe2\x80\x9d identical sound sources are responsible for the Python\xe2\x80\x99s true line array characteristics. It claims a perfect phase response both in the near and in the far fields and as a compact column it provided the necessary uniformity for the stadium seating in the arena.\nA total of 56 Python line arrays were installed horizontally throughout the bleachers to successfully provide accurate audio without obstructing the view of the competitions.\nClear-Com Communications\nSometimes technology that defines guest experience is invisible to the guests themselves. Proper communications during Olympics venue operations are of paramount importance to everyone involved.\nAt the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, the team at The P.A. People and OneUp Solutions ensured that the Clear-Com systems in use kept a large portion of key venue personnel in touch before, during, and after events.\nThe Clear-Com system is used for the sports A/V presentation in the venue. Timing and results all link back to Olympics Broadcasting Service (the host broadcaster which supplies images and sounds to all the partner broadcast organizations) and into the actual sport federation itself, says Scott Davidson, senior systems engineer, Event Communications, The P.A. People. \xe2\x80\x9cWe also have three venues here that are fiber-trunked together, and that provides some real good flexibility to join the three systems together while also giving autonomy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nChris Dodds, managing director, The P.A. People, notes that every system has three major components: the Matrix, the Partyline, and the FreeSpeak devices. \xe2\x80\x9cTo our knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the first time that serious quantities of full-duplex comms have been used for an Olympics.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt each of 15 locations, a mix of Clear-Com intercom systems are deployed, including the Eclipse HX matrix system as a central system, FOR-22 module cards for two-way radio interfacing, LQ-R4W8 IP interface for eight rings of audio interface to HelixNet, HelixNet Digital Partyline Main Stations, and a FreeSpeak II Base Station or E-QUE card.\nField equipment used by the operators includes 400 FreeSpeak II wireless intercom beltpacks and headsets (for mobile users), 115 FreeSpeak II transceivers and 30 splitters, 180 V-Series Lever keypanels, 440 HelixNet digital beltpacks, 100 CC110 lightweight headsets, 100 CC200 lightweight headsets, 500 CC300 headsets, and 300 CC400 headsets.\nSydney-based The P.A. People has the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Clear-Com rental inventory and worked with Korea-based OneUp Solutions on the project. The systems are not cookie-cutter and require different quantities of certain elements (particularly at the endpoints), and Davidson says the flexibility of the system and the HelixNet beltpacks has been good for all involved.\nAll of the endpoints are IP-capable, so the system can depoly using network switches for all elements. HelixNet adds to that versatility because uniquely every channel of the Partyline system can share one cable and select the required channels at the beltpack.\nLeyard TWS Series\nFor NBC Olympics, a division of the NBC Sports Group, Leyard supplied three TWS Series LED video walls for the dramatic set within the International Broadcast Center.\nThe Leyard video walls include a 43-foot wide by 13-foot tall video wall comprised of 196 displays, a 16-foot wide by 8-foot tall video wall comprised of 36 displays, and three 4-foot wide by 7-foot tall video walls in an athlete interview area.\nThe walls uniquely integrated with the scenic design that soon became familiar to Olympic viewers at home, and of course to all the athletes summoned there for interviews.\nStateside Olympics AV\nBeyond the guests who enjoyed the 2018 Winter Olympics in person, and the millions who tuned in via television and internet, Olympic distribution got a new audience and a new twist with the first-ever public DOOH network featuring Olympics content.\nNBC Olympics partnered with smart cities technology pioneers and media company Intersection to show exclusive content of the PyeongChang Olympics across four thousand large format digital screens in public places in the U.S. throughout the winter games. This is the first time the official Olympics broadcaster is cutting content specifically for the digital out-of-home medium. The Olympics content was seen in New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia during its production of the XXIII Olympic Winter Games.\nLynkNYC, the public screen-based system in New York City\xe2\x80\x93the largest and fastest free public Wi-Fi network in the world according to Intersection\xe2\x80\x94was part of the program. LinkNYC was one of the first smart cities networks based on interactive screens in the U.S., It has always had a substantial public access component that went beyond a passive \xe2\x80\x9cdigital signage\xe2\x80\x9d model and towards more civic engagement especially for demographics with less mobile internet access.\nThe custom content for the 2018 Winter Games, specifically created for Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s urban network of digital screens, will keep people up-to-date on the PyeongChang Olympics. The program will feature morning highlights, primetime previews, an Opening Ceremony teaser, medal counts, real-time alerts, athlete profiles and more, spanning thousands of screens across the LinkNYC network in New York City; digital urban panels and platform displays in the Chicago Transit Authority; and digital bus shelters, urban panels and platform displays throughout SEPTA, PATCO and the streets of Philadelphia.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether walking the streets of New York, riding the Chicago L, or waiting in Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s 30th Street Station, Olympics fans in these three cities will be surrounded by the excitement of the Winter Games,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gary Zenkel, President, NBC Olympics. \xe2\x80\x9cEmerging media platforms like the LinkNYC network in New York City represent another way for NBCUniversal to reassemble the television audience by extending the reach of our Olympic coverage, content and promotion to spaces where the American audience now consumes media.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur content partnership reflects a new approach to storytelling in cities using one of the most inspiring and unifying global events,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ari Buchalter, CEO of Intersection. \xe2\x80\x9cWith thousands of digital screens across our cities and transit hubs, our partnership allows us to bring NBC\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of the Winter Games to fans in entirely new ways, and create unique content and advertising experiences for consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93David Keene\nFeatured Articles\nNews\nAudinate Unveils Revolutionary New Dante-As-Software Products for Manufacturers and Developers\nSVC Event\nTraining Track: Intro to AV Industry Training\nRelated\nThe Wire\nMorris Light & Sound uses new SL-Series for two main stages at CMA Fest\n\xe2\x80\x94Supports five stages with d&b loudspeakers\xe2\x80\x94 ASHEVILLE, NC 6.20.19\xe2\x80\x94Every year for 48 years, CMA Fest draws hundreds of thousands of country music fans and this year did not miss...\nThe Wire\nPassaic County Technical Institute Upgrades Studio with JVC CONNECTED CAM Cameras\nWAYNE, NJ (June 20, 2019) \xe2\x80\x93 JVC Professional Video, a division of JVCKENWOOD USA Corporation, today announced Passaic County Technical Institute, a vocational high school in Wayne, upgraded its...\nThe Wire\nAVL Integration Firm Clair Solutions Builds Out the Woodward Theatre at the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame & Museum\nOWENSBORO, KENTUCKY:\xc2\xa0As an institution, the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum is over 25 years old, but the building it\xe2\x80\x99s housed in is brand new.

The funding will be distributed to projects in Austin;\xc2\xa0Chattanooga, TN; Eugene, OR; Kansas City, MO; and Lafayette, LA.\nThe projects all use high-speed internet of at least 1 gigabit per second to improve education and teacher training in the winning cities.\nThe grants range from $10,000 to $30,000 each, for a total of $280,000 for this round of funding. Mozilla has now awarded $1.2 million in grants through its six-year gigabit program.\nDive Insight:\nAs more cities become gigabit communities \xe2\x80\x94 including recently-added Las Vegas, San Francisco,\xc2\xa0Lexington, KY and Colorado Springs, CO \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s a push to find new uses for the super-fast service. Although service providers often tout lightning fast download speeds that allow users to download 90-minute movies in 30 seconds, the average user doesn\'t fully comprehend the potential of a service that offers speeds up to 1,000 megabits per second. New York provides free gigabit Wi-Fi from its LinkNYC interactive kiosks, but again, the average user hasn\'t been properly informed of the potential such service holds beyond the "cool" factor of exceptional speed.\nThe Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund Program broke through that barrier and funded the development of projects that help communities with the ultra-fast internet service. This round of funding focused on education, both for enhancing student education and teacher training.\nEducation is an area that perennially struggles to secure adequate funding just for daily activities, much less innovation and technological advances. School systems are increasingly relying on partnerships to fill the gaps, such as with the partnership between Chicago and Apple to provide nearly 500,000 students with coding classes.\nA number of the 14 projects that received grants centered on virtual reality (VR). Many people who hear that term automatically think of video games and might not understand what that has to do with education, but the project developers found ways to make it incredibly relevant. They use VR on the gigabit service to provide students, often underserved students in low-income communities, with alternative education methods and opportunities they otherwise would not have. Plus, gamifying learning can be successful in making the information more comprehensive, which helps it stick with students better.\nA project in Lafayette and Chattanooga allows middle and high school students to take virtual reality field trips to solar energy plants, while another in Lafayette teaches students about broadcast and livestream technologies they can use as community journalists. A project in Eugene empowers at-risk students to be environmental watchdogs by using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to track wetland restoration initiatives, and another environmental project uses VR to show students in Lafayette the impact of coastal erosion and climate change, especially the effects on a displaced Native American tribe. A project in Lafayette and Kansas City uses internet-connected emerging technologies such as robotic puppets and 3-D printing to teach history.\nThe funding doesn\'t stop at projects for students, though; it also extends to teachers, who are sometimes a forgotten group in the education sphere. Without their own training in emerging fields and technologies, teachers can\'t adequately educate students. One of the newly-funded projects in Lafayette trains elementary and middle school teachers about cloud-based programming and connected robotics, and one in Eugene will provide teachers at low-income schools with VR and video game development training. Another project in Eugene uses VR training to help teachers eliminate their unconscious biases, which could mitigate disproportionate suspensions and expulsions for minority students.\nThese programs and others are helping entrepreneurs to get more exposure for their technological advances and the benefits of gigabit internet service. They also help to bridge the digital divide that holds back low-income and minority residents from experiencing the same benefits of technology as more well-off segments of communities, which is a major concern as cities become increasingly connected.\nRecommended Reading:\nVentureBeat\nMozilla awards final grants from its $1.2 million Community Gigabit Fund\nFollow\nKatie Pyzyk\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nRyan McKnight (Industry Dive)\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Smart Cities Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nSmart Cities Dive\nTopics covered: energy, green building, transportation, waste solutions, connectivity, policy and more.\nDaily\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

[Analysis] by Claus Hetting | April 3, 2018By Claus Hetting, Wi-Fi NOW CEO & ChairmanIs New York street light Wi-Fi feasible? That is the looming question after the New York Post & others\xc2\xa0broke this story on New York City\xe2\x80\x99s desire to embark on yet another massive public Wi-Fi project. Here\xe2\x80\x99s our non-exhaustive take on this complex \xe2\x80\x93 but fascinating \xe2\x80\x93 subject.Even with the world\xe2\x80\x99s no. 1 city Wi-Fi flagship project \xe2\x80\x93 LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x93 expanding as planned, New York City wants more Wi-Fi. The latest idea is to equip some 250,000 street lights across all five boroughs with Wi-Fi in an attempt to expand the availability of affordable Internet access in New York.If the project happens, the new Wi-Fi service would be part of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious plan to push for \xe2\x80\x9cevery city resident and business to have affordable, reliable, high-speed Internet service by 2025,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York Post reports.The technical pieces already existThe idea may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Swapping out old street lights for more energy-efficient LED-based units that include Wi-Fi APs is a fairly well-know concept, with companies like Wi-Fiber, Soluxio, Citintelly, and\xc2\xa0Ventev leading the way. Thus far nothing on the scale of New York City has been deployed. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.Ventev has developed as series of concealed antenna solutions for outdoor lighting that might be just what cities are looking for. Powering the APs should be straight-forward although backhaul \xe2\x80\x93 as always \xe2\x80\x93 is more tricky. Some kind of mesh network for backhaul seems an obvious choice. Maybe the time has come for using 60 GHz (aka WiGig) radios or something akin to Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s Terragraph.Security is always an issue in Wi-Fi and there would be two ways of dealing with that: Either allow users to access the service via a connectivity app only or insist on using 802.11X/EAP including certificates for authentication. Either is possible although using a connectivity app might be the less costly and more user-friendly option.The timing could be just about rightThe timing could be just about right for a project of this kind given that the next major Wi-Fi standard is expected to hit the markets in earnest some time next year.The 802.11ax standard comes with at least two new features useful for outdoor dense city Wi-Fi deployments: Much longer range and much better performance in high-density environments.Add to this that the FCC within the foreseeable future may release a lot more spectrum for Wi-Fi in the 6 GHz band\xc2\xa0and that the new 802.11ax is already defined for use with this new spectrum. The Wi-Fi industry is also well on its way to introducing mobility (handoff), which means that the Wi-Fi experience should feel a lot more like what many consumers are used to with cellular.The key: Attracting partnersIn the end what would make or break such a project is the existence (or not) of a harmonious trifecta of money, city politics, and \xe2\x80\x93 well \xe2\x80\x93 even federal politics on regulating telco access to city infrastructure, such as light poles. The first question is of course who or what is going to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 A public-private partnership model may be the way to go, says one expert.\xe2\x80\x9cA large city like New York would be able to attract interest in a public-private partnership to fund and operate such a network,\xe2\x80\x9d says David Witkowski, Executive Director at Joint Venture Silicon Valley and co-author of the \xe2\x80\x98Public Wi-Fi Supercluster Blueprint\xe2\x80\x99 report. The report is \xe2\x80\x98how-to guide\xe2\x80\x99 on how to make free public Wi-Fi happen.Witkowski refers to the complex corporate and partnership structure of LinkNYC as an example of how a major public-private partnership model can be put together. \xe2\x80\x9cThe success of any such project will depend on wether Mayor de Blasio will be able to attract the right companies to make the level of investment required,\xe2\x80\x9d Witkowski says./Claus.\nWi-Fi Industry NewsJune 20, 2019 [Regulation & Policy]Europe\xe2\x80\x99s process to release 6 GHz spectrum to Wi-Fi on track, expert saysJune 18, 2019 [Breaking News]Emergency \xe2\x80\x98Ducklink\xe2\x80\x99 Wi-Fi to save lives during disastersJune 17, 2019 [Breaking News]Facebook takes on leadership role to improve Wi-FiJune 16, 2019 [News Exclusive]South Africa: Vast Networks\xe2\x80\x99 Wi-Fi offload trial with Vodacom \xe2\x80\x98faster than cellular\xe2\x80\x99June 13, 2019 [Breaking News]World\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Wi-Fi 6 trial tees off at US Open with Cisco & USGAJune 12, 2019 [Weekly News Brief]Wi-Fi news roundup: Aruba, Marvell, Quantenna, Newracom, and moreJune 12, 2019 [Breaking News]Greece to start building nationwide free public Wi-Fi networkMay 30, 2019 [Breaking News]Cuba to legalise private Wi-Fi networks by end JulyMay 30, 2019 [Breaking News]Wi-Fi 6 enters steep growth phase far outpacing 5G, says IDCMay 30, 2019 [CHIPSET NEWS]Wi-Fi HaLow IoT startup Morse Micro lands US$17M in Series A financingSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribe to Wi-Fi NOW Get the latest Wi-Fi industry news & information from Wi-Fi NOW every weekName*\nFirst\nLast CompanyEmail* Country*\nAfghanistan\xc3\x85land IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarrussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Democratic Republic of theCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaC\xc3\xb4te d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCura\xc3\xa7aoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\xc3\xa9unionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Barth\xc3\xa9lemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen IslandsSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe Country\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

The Park Slope updates are part of a citywide rollout over the next several weeks.\nThe first few kiosks were located in the district of Councilman Brad Lander, who had pushed the city to update the kiosks primarily as a means to give New Yorkers access to free Wi-Fi and phone calls.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ... bus clocks we\xe2\x80\x99ve installed in our district and across the city prove that knowing when the next bus is coming is a real quality-of-life improvement for NYC\xe2\x80\x99s bus riders,\xe2\x80\x9d Lander said in a statement.\nThe kiosks, which also display subway service statuses, will offer bus arrival times for stops within walking distance \xe2\x80\x94 roughly a three-tenths-of-a-mile radius. While the MTA and third parties offer the same data through apps and text-based services, advocates said having the information on the kiosks helps modernize a bus service that has been steadily losing ridership in recent years.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCity buses need deep interventions before they will function adequately, and part of the path to turning around our failing bus service is to get more information into the hands of bus riders, in as many ways as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Raskin, executive director of Riders Alliance, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cAdding bus arrival times to LinkNYC kiosks is a smart and creative way to help bus riders save time, and it will help make the bus a more modern, convenient option for New Yorkers to choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince LinkNYC launched in 2016, more than 1,700 Links have been installed across the five boroughs. More than 3.6 million gigabytes of data has been used \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of sending 36 billion emails, the city points out. LinkNYC once also offered web access, but the city pulled the plug on the feature months after the launch due to complaints that users were monopolizing kiosks to visit illicit sites.\nEat it.

public screens, but New York City? Not so much -- you\'ll probably have to pull out your phone to know if you have a chance of making your ride. That shouldn\'t be a problem before long, as the city has launched a pilot program that puts real-time bus info on LinkNYC\'s gigabit WiFi kiosks. Visit one of 29 kiosks in Brooklyn\'s City Council District 39 and you can see arrival times for nearby stops at a glance, letting you know when you need to hustle.\nThe two plan to bring arrivals to kiosks in every borough in the "coming weeks."LinkNYC\'s stations were initially focused on plain internet access, phone charging and other fundamentals, but they\'ve gradually rolled in features like social service access and even messages to Santa. Bus data is just a logical extension of that strategy -- the kiosks are quickly becoming catch-alls for any info that might be helpful when you\'re navigating the sidewalks.\nSource:\nNYC DoITT\nIn this article:\nbus,\ngear,\ninternet,\nkiosk,\nlinknyc,\nmasstransit,\nNewYorkCity,\nnyc,\nPublicTransportation,\ntransportation\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

As of today, 29 Link kiosks in Brooklyn began displaying realtime information for busses up to one-third of a mile from their location, Crain\xe2\x80\x99s reports. The development is just the beginning of a larger rollout of the countdown display across some of the city\xe2\x80\x99s 1,550-plus kiosks.\nWhile the countdown clock function was always intended to come to the kiosks, it got a boost from Brooklyn City Council member Brad Lander who Crain\xe2\x80\x99s says began asking LinkNYC to post bus arrival information last September. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, it is one element of the overall bus turnaround effort,\xe2\x80\x9d Lander said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood service and good information together will increase ridership.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe rollout comes at a crucial time for New York City transit, as riders across the city will be called to rely more heavily on alternate modes of public transportation given the impending L-train shutdown and other subway fixes that may see some lines close for weekends at a time.\nLinkNYC kiosks will continue to provide services including charging outlets, fast WiFi, and free access to features like maps and domestic phone calls. The bus information will display between advertisements and other public notices.\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrategically, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on is this vision we have around transforming the Link from being just the means by which we get high-speed public Wi-Fi to really being a digital public service assistant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications Commissioner Samir Saini.\nLinkNYC kiosks to double as bus countdown clocks [Crain\xe2\x80\x99s]\nLinkNYC pulls the plug on web browsing at its kiosks [Curbed]\nNext Up In\nNYC Transportation\n14th Street busway will \xe2\x80\x98threaten the wellbeing\xe2\x80\x99 of residents: lawsuit\nNew York lawmakers vote to legalize e-bikes, e-scooters\nBrooklyn lawmaker wants to resurrect Triboro rail line\nStaten Island to get modernized bus fleet this year\nMTA wants vendors to transform vacant storefronts at major subway hubs\nAmbitious bill to overhaul NYC streets would require billions in funding, DOT says\nMost Read\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nThe apartment where the late rapper grew up is up for grabs\nWhat $1M buys in NYC right now\nFive apartments, five NYC neighborhoods\nSign up for the\nCurbed NY Newsletter\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 5.

Using bus time data, arrival information for buses within a short walking distance of Links will be broadcast on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of Link kiosks. LinkNYC will launch bus arrival time network-wide throughout all five boroughs in the coming weeks.\n\xc2\x93From voter registration to healthcare enrollment, and now with real-time bus information on Brooklyn kiosks, LinkNYC has once again proven to be more than just fast and free Wi-Fi,\xc2\x94 said Samir Saini, Commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. \xc2\x93I am proud to be a part of this expansive initiative where we can leverage technology to enhance public services\xc2\x97this is what keeps New York City on the leading edge of urban innovation. We thank Council Member Lander for working with us and look forward to expanding this service to bring value to New Yorkers in all five boroughs.\xc2\x94\n\xc2\x93We thank Council Member Lander for his advocacy around the need for real-time bus information on Links, which we will roll out network-wide in the coming weeks,\xc2\x94 said Jen Hensley, President of Link. \xc2\x93LinkNYC isn\xc2\x92t just the world\xc2\x92s largest, fastest free Wi-Fi network, it\xc2\x92s a platform to make life in New York City easier through delivering relevant local content and information.\xc2\x94\n\xc2\x93I want to thank LinkNYC and the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) for their openness to using the City\xc2\x92s technology and resources to rapidly expand access to real-time bus arrival information, citywide,\xc2\x94 says Council Member Brad Lander. \xc2\x93The \xc2\x91real-time passenger information\xc2\x92 (RTPI) bus clocks we\xc2\x92ve installed in our district and across the City prove that knowing when the next bus is coming is a real quality-of-life improvement for NYC\xc2\x92s bus riders. Now, thanks to LinkNYC and DoITT, riders will have access to that information on thousands of LinkNYC consoles along bus routes citywide, within just a couple of weeks.\xc2\x94\nLinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\xc2\x92s payphones to build the world\xc2\x92s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,700 Links are installed across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next few years.\nLinkNYC\nLike what we have to say?

You get to come together, meet your neighbors, and make your community a better place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city also lowered the voting age to 11 years old, giving more New Yorkers a say in how taxpayer dollars are spent.\nOn Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio cast his vote for projects at the 39th council district office in Brooklyn.\nLast year, residents voted on where more than $40 million in funding should be spent in participating districts. Previous PBNYC projects that received funding include: transforming an empty lot in Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen into a public park; the creation of a STEM lab at the Young Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership School in Astoria; and the installation of sidewalk extensions and a way-finding station at a three-way intersection in Borough Park.\nGet Breaking News emails\nThe latest about your city, as it happens.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nOver $30 million in funding is available for public projects this year. Voting on this year\xe2\x80\x99s projects began April 7 and ends\xc2\xa0on Sunday.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what you need to know about the Participatory Budgeting process.\nHow it works\nEach year, members of the City Council have the option of joining in the PBNYC process by pledging a minimum of $1 million from their budget.\nCommunity members can submit project ideas online and volunteers, called Budget Delegates, will help develop those ideas into proposals that then go onto a voting ballot.\nResidents in participating districts are given a week to vote on all the proposals in their district.\nVoters can choose up to five PBNYC projects in their district. The projects with the most votes will receive funding from the council member representing that district until the full amount of PBNYC funding they allocated is used up.\nWhat kind of projects can be proposed\nFrom parks and housing to sanitation and schools, there are a wide variety of proposal categories that qualify for PBNYC funding. However, the funding can only be used on proposals for physical infrastructure projects, like renovating a public library meeting room. The money can\xe2\x80\x99t be used for proposals that involve improving services, such as adding more staff to a city resource program.\nYou can submit your idea online via the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s website, however, this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC proposal cycle has already closed.\nBelow is a list of project categories that are eligible for funding:\nParks and recreation Sanitation Transit and transportation Housing Environment Schools and education Public health Youth Streets and sidewalks Seniors Public safety Culture and community facilities\nCouncil districts participating this year\nThere are 27 council districts, representing parts of each borough, that have finalized ballots for this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC vote. The following districts are participating this year: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 47, 49.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re unsure what district you live in, you can find out by visiting the City Council PBNYC website.\nWhat projects are being proposed in which districts this year\nNow that you know whether your council member is participating, you can find out what projects are being proposed in your neighborhood online via the City Council PBNYC website. Clicking on your council member\xe2\x80\x99s name will bring you to a page that lists the proposed projects, with a description and funding amount for each.\nWhen and how you can vote\nVoting is open to all New Yorkers 11 years old or older\xc2\xa0who live in a participating council district. Each district lists several locations where you can vote in person or you can vote online.\nVoting for this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC projects began Saturday, April 7, and will end on Sunday, April 15. In order to vote, you will need to sign an affidavit that confirms your residency and age.\nHow to get involved in PBNYC\nThe City Council welcomes volunteers interested in getting involved in the PBNYC process beyond proposals and voting.\nCommunity members can become a volunteer Budget Delegate or poll worker, join a district committee or PBNYC citywide committee and participate in a working group that provides input on initiatives that impact PBNYC.\nBy Lauren Cook lauren.cook@amny.com\n@L_Cook865\nLauren joined amNY.com as a news editor in 2016.

You get to come together, meet your neighbors, and make your community a better place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city also lowered the voting age to 11 years old, giving more New Yorkers a say in how taxpayer dollars are spent.\nOn Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio cast his vote for projects at the 39th council district office in Brooklyn.\nLast year, residents voted on where more than $40 million in funding should be spent in participating districts. Previous PBNYC projects that received funding include: transforming an empty lot in Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen into a public park; the creation of a STEM lab at the Young Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership School in Astoria; and the installation of sidewalk extensions and a way-finding station at a three-way intersection in Borough Park.\nGet Breaking News emails\nThe latest about your city, as it happens.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nOver $30 million in funding is available for public projects this year. Voting on this year\xe2\x80\x99s projects began April 7 and ends\xc2\xa0on Sunday.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what you need to know about the Participatory Budgeting process.\nHow it works\nEach year, members of the City Council have the option of joining in the PBNYC process by pledging a minimum of $1 million from their budget.\nCommunity members can submit project ideas online and volunteers, called Budget Delegates, will help develop those ideas into proposals that then go onto a voting ballot.\nResidents in participating districts are given a week to vote on all the proposals in their district.\nVoters can choose up to five PBNYC projects in their district. The projects with the most votes will receive funding from the council member representing that district until the full amount of PBNYC funding they allocated is used up.\nWhat kind of projects can be proposed\nFrom parks and housing to sanitation and schools, there are a wide variety of proposal categories that qualify for PBNYC funding. However, the funding can only be used on proposals for physical infrastructure projects, like renovating a public library meeting room. The money can\xe2\x80\x99t be used for proposals that involve improving services, such as adding more staff to a city resource program.\nYou can submit your idea online via the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s website, however, this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC proposal cycle has already closed.\nBelow is a list of project categories that are eligible for funding:\nParks and recreation Sanitation Transit and transportation Housing Environment Schools and education Public health Youth Streets and sidewalks Seniors Public safety Culture and community facilities\nCouncil districts participating this year\nThere are 27 council districts, representing parts of each borough, that have finalized ballots for this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC vote. The following districts are participating this year: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 47, 49.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re unsure what district you live in, you can find out by visiting the City Council PBNYC website.\nWhat projects are being proposed in which districts this year\nNow that you know whether your council member is participating, you can find out what projects are being proposed in your neighborhood online via the City Council PBNYC website. Clicking on your council member\xe2\x80\x99s name will bring you to a page that lists the proposed projects, with a description and funding amount for each.\nWhen and how you can vote\nVoting is open to all New Yorkers 11 years old or older\xc2\xa0who live in a participating council district. Each district lists several locations where you can vote in person or you can vote online.\nVoting for this year\xe2\x80\x99s PBNYC projects began Saturday, April 7, and will end on Sunday, April 15. In order to vote, you will need to sign an affidavit that confirms your residency and age.\nHow to get involved in PBNYC\nThe City Council welcomes volunteers interested in getting involved in the PBNYC process beyond proposals and voting.\nCommunity members can become a volunteer Budget Delegate or poll worker, join a district committee or PBNYC citywide committee and participate in a working group that provides input on initiatives that impact PBNYC.\nBy Lauren Cook lauren.cook@amny.com\n@L_Cook865\nLauren joined amNY.com as a news editor in 2016.

(Courtesy: Intersection)\nBy Karen Yi | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\nNewark will be the fourth city in the world -- and the first in New Jersey -- to provide high-speed wifi "Link" kiosks that will allow pedestrians to charge their phones, make a call or download music and movies, free of charge.The multi-million dollar investment in the city by\xc2\xa0Intersection, a New York-based technology company, comes at an exciting time for Newark,\xc2\xa0which was recently named a\xc2\xa0finalist\xc2\xa0for Amazon\'s second headquarters.\n"Newark is here, we are on the map," Aisha Glover, president of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation (NCEDC) said\xc2\xa0during\xc2\xa0a Wednesday press conference at NJIT. "We are claiming our space. We certainly feel like this is our moment."The city will also host this year\'s VOICE Technology Summit, the largest voice technology conference that gathers 1,500 developers and designers. The summit is sponsored by Amazon Alexa."The idea that this city is\xc2\xa0on its way to be a tech hub is outstanding,"\xc2\xa0NJIT President Joel Bloom said. The college will host the three-day conference July 24-26.Dan Doctoroff, chairman of Intersection, echoed those sentiments and said the company was betting on Newark. Intersection will install 45 LinkNWK sidewalk kiosks by the end of the year -- at no cost to the city.Many\xc2\xa0of the kiosks will be\xc2\xa0installed in the downtown corridor (along Broad and Market streets and Irvine Turner and Martin Luther King Blvds) with at least two kiosks in the each ward, including in major commercial corridors like Ferry Street, Clinton Avenue and Bloomfield Avenue.\nDoctoroff declined to detail the company\'s investment except to say it was "several million dollars." Intersection makes its money through\xc2\xa0ads on the digital screens and some of that revenue will also be shared with NCEDC and the city. A minority investor in Intersection is Sidewalk Labs, which was created by Alphabet, the parent company of Google.LinkNWK will let passersby make calls anywhere in the U.S., charge their devices and provide free high-speed\xc2\xa0wifi connected to Newark Fiber -- the city\'s public-private gigabit data network. The 55-inch\xc2\xa0digital screens on each side will also improve city communications and help inform residents of garbage pick-up days, parking rules and relate other important messages.\nLinkNYC kiosk.\nIntersection already operates 1,600 Link kiosks in New York City, London and Philadelphia. And it\'s not without its kinks. When the program first rolled out in New York in 2016, there were\xc2\xa0reports that people were using the devices to watch pornography.Doctoroff said\xc2\xa0Intersection\xc2\xa0learned from operating two years in New York City\xc2\xa0and would apply those lesson in Newark, including turning off the internet browser and having a robust privacy policy.\nThe bigger goal, he said, was to help cities grow by improving connectivity and communication. And Newark, he said, was finally\xc2\xa0growing as a tech hub."We are looking for places where we can grow and utilize assets that are in the ground," said Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor in New York City who noted that he was born in Newark. "This is Newark\'s time."Karen Yi may be reached at\xc2\xa0kyi@njadvancemedia.com.

Now a snowgie.Think of yourself this morning as in the middle of a snow sandwich. After five and a half inches fell on Monday, we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting more snow tomorrow and through the weekend \xe2\x80\x94 which is looking extra chilly to boot, with temperatures about 20 degrees below normal.We\xe2\x80\x99re currently keeping our eye on three systems that may make a mess of the city.The first arrives tonight and could drop around an inch of snow during tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\x99s commute, before turning to rain.On Saturday, expect the opposite, said Faye Morrone, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service \xe2\x80\x94 rain in the morning, snow during the day, then more rain at night. The high on Saturday is a wintry 39, well below the average of 58.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty cold start to the month,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Morrone said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that looks to continue through the weekend and into next week.\xe2\x80\x9dDaily lows should stay in the 30s until next Thursday.And the climatological crystal ball is predicting a possible nor\xe2\x80\x99easter on Monday, though it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to know with any certainty, Ms. Morrone told us.While we wait to find out, put on a mitten and pat yourself on your back: You\xe2\x80\x99ve now trudged through 40.9 inches of snow this winter and spring, nearly 16 inches more than the average snow season.This April has already landed among the city\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 snowiest (at No. 8), and it\xe2\x80\x99s only the first week.\xe2\x80\x9cAny snow that we pick up in these next three chances would only bump that up,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Morrone said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe definitely seem to be in a pattern where the temperatures are cold enough to support those chances.\xe2\x80\x9dBut this is April, after all, the month that makes meteorologists look foolish, so expect plenty of chance.No curveballs today, though.

bus info to LinkNYC kiosks, starting in Brooklyn | StateScoop\nSubscribe\nAbout\nRSS\nBrought to you by\nSpecial Reports\nState\nCity\nCounty & Local\nWatch\nListen\nAttend\nContent Studio\nNew York adds bus info to LinkNYC kiosks, starting in Brooklyn\nShare\nWritten by Benjamin Freed\nApr 5, 2018 | STATESCOOP\nSince early 2016, New York City has installed about 1,700 LinkNYC kiosks\xc2\xa0offering free Wi-Fi, mobile-device charging stations, and access to city services where now-antiquated phone booths once stood. As of this week, 29 kiosks in Brooklyn will now display real-time\xc2\xa0bus schedules, city officials announced Wednesday, with the updates spreading to the rest of the city not long after.\nThe bus-information upgrade was announced by LinkNYC, which is privately operated and managed by the Citybridge consortium;\xc2\xa0the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of\xc2\xa0Information Technology and Telecommunications;\xc2\xa0and City Council member Brad Lander, who\xc2\xa0represents neighborhoods like Park Slope and Cobble Hill. The initial 29\xc2\xa0kiosks getting the bus information are all in\xc2\xa0Lander\xe2\x80\x99s district.\nKiosks will show pedestrians which bus lines they\xe2\x80\x99re on, and how many stops away the nearest bus is, with the relevant information being dowloaded from the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The arrival times will be shown on the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 55-inch digital screens. Citybridge, a group\xc2\xa0of advertising and communications companies, also sells ads on the displays.\nCity officials boast of LinkNYC having one of the quickest internet connections in New York, with the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 broadcasting gigabit-speed Wi-Fi that\xe2\x80\x99s 100 times faster than typical public wireless and 40 times faster than the average home connection, according to the service\xe2\x80\x99s website.\nThe\xc2\xa0Android tablet computers implanted in each kiosk already allowed users to access city maps and social services. The kiosks also support phones that offer free domestic phone calls. Along with the free wireless internet and device charging, city officials estimate LinkNYC has already been used 3.5 million times since the first kiosks were installed, with Wi-Fi users going through more than 3,625 terabytes of data. CIVIQ, which\xc2\xa0manufactures the kiosks,\xc2\xa0has also\xc2\xa0deployed them in\xc2\xa0London, and similar\xc2\xa0systems are being planned in Chicago and Miami.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom voter registration to healthcare enrollment, and now with real-time bus information on Brooklyn kiosks, LinkNYC has once again proven to be more than just fast and free Wi-Fi,\xe2\x80\x9d DoITT Commissioner Samir Saini says in a press release.\nLander may have more of a rooting interest in getting the real-time bus information on the kiosks. Many of his\xc2\xa0constituents might soon be familiarizing themselves with their local bus schedules in preparation for next year\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled shutdown of the subway\xe2\x80\x99s L train, a vital link for Brooklynites headed into Manhattan.\nCity officials do not expect the Brooklyn pilot to last more than a few weeks before the real-time bus information spreads to the rest of the kiosk network. The pilot is mostly to make sure the bus schedules are functioning properly and meeting user-experience requirements. LinkNYC also\xc2\xa0plans to collect direct\xc2\xa0feedback from users who are frequent bus passengers.\n-In this Story-\nCivic Tech, Digital Services, LinkNYC, New York, New York City, Samir Saini, State & Local News, States, Tech News, Transportation\nRelated news\nCity\nLos Angeles city controller updates online property map to boost housing, economy\nby Colin Wood \xe2\x80\xa2 2 hours ago\nCity\n'Bootcamp' program aims to boost New York City's cybersecurity workforce\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 6 hours ago\nCity\nDetroit kicks off Ford-backed transportation challenge\nby Ryan Johnston \xe2\x80\xa2 6 hours ago\nAd Specs\nSponsor\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Scoop News Group\n|\nAll Rights Reserved\nSearch for:\nThe latest state and local government tech news, delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

The countdowns will naturally be squeezed between advertisements and other public information that cycles through the screens. The commuting inclusion was spearheaded by Brooklyn\xc2\xa0Councilman Brad Lander, who has been pushing for this addition since September 2017.\nA LinkNYC spokesperson had stated that a countdown was \xe2\x80\x9con the roadmap\xe2\x80\x9d of future programming endeavours, but the councilman\xe2\x80\x99s proactive interest sped up the launch.\nThe Link network is a public-private partnership that relies on advertising revenue to provide free services such as wi-fi, domestic phone capability, two USB charging ports, mapping services, neighborhood history,\xc2\xa0and at one time, porn.\nOf course, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the less landscape-invasive option of using the MTA Bus Time App\xc2\xa0instead, presumably where LinkNYC is pulling its data from in the first place. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, you\xe2\x80\x99re still at the mercy of mediocrity.\n[h/t Crains New York]\nShare\nShare\nTweet\nTagsBus LinkNYC\nStreetsDelancey Street\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nStay Connected:\nRecent Stories\nTV/Film Art Pigeon of Elizabeth Street Garden Stars in Next Season of HBO\xe2\x80\x99s The DeuceWhen both sides of the street are lined with 1970s gas-guzzlers, it could only mean one thing.

Makes taking the bus a little bit better! https://t.co/ZY624f7Yhw pic.twitter.com/G1oCIdyWoq\xe2\x80\x94 Brad Lander (@bradlander) April 4, 2018Lander told Technical.ly in February about a pilot of the idea in his district. He said the idea for bus countdown clocks came out of participatory budgeting suggestions in years past but that it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated and expensive process, with the price for each standalone countdown clock at about $35,000. The LinkNYC kiosks seemed like they could be a quick fix for getting that functionality. AdvertisementThe LinkNYC kiosks, which provide free WiFi for nearby users, are paid for primarily by the ads that appear on the screens on the sides of them. There is some time set aside for use of those screens by the city on some of the kiosks, but Lander said that, along with DoITT, the parties agreed to post the countdowns in place of some ad time and without compensation from the city.\xe2\x80\x9cThe nice thing was that Link agreed this would be valuable content to provide. Obviously, they want these things to be valuable things to look at, so they\xe2\x80\x99re putting it up in \xe2\x80\x98their\xe2\x80\x99 time,\xe2\x80\x9d Lander explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t become things people want to look at, that will be self-defeating because no one will be looking at them. If it helps New Yorkers, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at the Links, thus making the ad space more valuable.\xe2\x80\x9dLander said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately have any other ideas for using technology to improve city life, but noted that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have this idea in the first place exactly, either.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the answer is that elected officials will have great tech ideas for how to improve the city, but that we have a lot of people with ideas, such as how to make it a little easier to wait for the bus. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to a lot more of those ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.From where we sit, there\xe2\x80\x99s no shortage of ideas for civic tech. The pain point often occurs where implementation with government departments and organizations. That Lander was able to actually get several parties to sit down and agree to this and implement it in a pretty quick time period might be the most innovative part of this whole project.\n-30-\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY, BECOME A MEMBER\nAlready a member?

The kiosks have Wi-Fi connectivity and allow users to charge their phones, make calls and download music or movies for free.\nMeanwhile, State Scoop reports\xc2\xa0that the LinkNYC service in New York City will add bus arrival times to 29 kiosks in Brooklyn, with the service set to expand to the rest of the 1,700 kiosks in the city\xe2\x80\x99s other boroughs soon.\nThe kiosks will show users nearby bus lines and how far away the next bus is, using information downloaded from the city\xe2\x80\x99s Metropolitan Transit Authority. Transit officials told StateScoop the Brooklyn pilot should last "[no] more than a few weeks"\xc2\xa0before it spreads elsewhere in the city.\nDive Insight:\nThe use of the Link Wi-Fi kiosks\xc2\xa0has been expanding across several cities in recent years as they look to reduce the "digital divide"\xc2\xa0and make the internet accessible for all residents. In addition, the initiative has generated millions of dollars in revenue for New York City through advertising and has created new jobs, while others report that retail business near the kiosks has experienced an uptick.\nThe kiosks could be even more effective in Newark, as Fierce Telecom reports they will run over the Newark Fiber network, offering high speeds on the city\xe2\x80\x99s public-private gigabit data network already linked to several other buildings. Intersection, one of the companies behind the LinkNWK kiosks, will install 45 by the end of the year at no cost to the city.\nInstallation is set to be largely focused in Newark\xe2\x80\x99s downtown corridor, and comes with the city a finalist for Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s HQ2\xc2\xa0and looking to flex its muscles as a leading place for new technological innovations. Not only should this help the city move toward that goal, it will also provide an opportunity for all residents to be involved in this revolution. "Newark is here, we are on the map," Aisha Glover, president of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation (NCEDC) reportedly said during a Wednesday press conference at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\nNew York\xe2\x80\x99s push to add bus schedules to its LinkNYC kiosks represents another step forward, too. More and more, cities are pushing to standardize arrival time information for public transportation, including for the blind like in Austin\xc2\xa0or in cities like Chicago, which provides service updates and emergency messages. "From voter registration to healthcare enrollment, and now with real-time bus information on Brooklyn kiosks, LinkNYC has once again proven to be more than just fast and free Wi-Fi," Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications Commissioner Samir Saini said in a statement, per StateScoop.\nRecommended Reading:\nState Scoop\nNew York adds bus info to LinkNYC kiosks, starting in Brooklyn\nNJ.com\nSoon you can charge your phone, make calls for free around this N.J. city\nFierce Telecom\nNewark Fiber\xe2\x80\x99s gigabit network becomes engine for LinkNWK smart city initiative\nFollow\nChris Teale\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTransportation\nTop image credit:\nWikimedia Commons\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Smart Cities Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nSmart Cities Dive\nTopics covered: energy, green building, transportation, waste solutions, connectivity, policy and more.\nDaily\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

There could also be additional revenue to put toward future smart city projects, Intersection predicted.\nNew York City has connected more than 1,700 LinkNYC kiosks since 2016, but it has ambitions of reaching 7,500 kiosks by 2020 in its effort to build citywide free Wi-Fi network. On April 4 the city launched a pilot project to add bus arrival times for stops near kiosk locations.\nAbout the Author\nMatt Leonard is a former reporter for GCN.\nE-Mail this page\nPrintable

However, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how they collect data if you don\xe2\x80\x99t use the WiFi, don\xe2\x80\x99t connect for power, and don\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise interact with them \xe2\x80\x93 though if I understand correctly, waking around leaving Bluetooth and WiFi on in the settings of your phone does leave some trace on the WiFi networks you pass even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t connect. If someone actually knows whether that is true, I would appreciate an explanation.\nEmilio says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 10:10 am\nAll I see using those things are drug addicts and bums that hog it up not sure if that is any useful.\ndannyboy says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 2:36 pm\nI guess you see what you expect.\nrs says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 10:52 am\nIs it just me?\nI\xe2\x80\x99m never able to connect my phone to a kiosk.\nSeymour Glass says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 10:52 am\nThe free WiFi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work very well.\nI have connected many times but the kiosks don\xe2\x80\x99t automatically recognize my device and I have to log in every time.\nAnd until I do, my device is connected to the wifi without internet access.\nAnyone have the same problem or figured out a way to overcome?\nIndependent says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 5:04 pm\n@ Seymour Glass, #6:\nWhat you have described is, I believe, the way \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d public WiFi generally works. The initial wireless connection only works for accessing the web page (known, I believe, as a captive portal) where one must log-on\xe2\x80\x93 a process that includes affirmatively accepting terms of service. Only after doing that is one granted full access to the Web. I believe that time-limits, after which one must at least accept the terms and log-on anew, are also quite common, if not standard.\ngeoff says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 12:07 pm\nexactly where is the camera, and how high off the ground?\nMark Moore says:\nApril 9, 2018 at 10:57 am\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the center behind the dark glass, up near the top of the tower.

I hope if there is an emergency they will flash the emergency to the public. Weather wise or other wise.\nUpperBestSide says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 5:23 pm\nThis is good news. The Wifi kiosks offer easy access and fast internet speeds, especially to those without data plans or smartphones. In my experience however, the kiosks restrict devices from connecting to them if the devices are inside a building, rather than on the street. I think these would be much more beneficial to the UWS and many other neighborhoods if they provided those without internet access in their homes access to a network with a strong connection.\nCato says:\nApril 9, 2018 at 10:27 am\nYou need to read George Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s 1984 (or re-read it if you read it in middle school, thinking it was a creepy science-fiction story).\nAs you read it, think about:\nHow much of this is already the case?\nHow much of it am I *trying* to make it the case?\nYeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s lobby to get universal government-provided internet access in our living rooms from central kiosks.\nWake up, Winston Smith!\ndannyboy says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 8:29 am\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith\nWinston Smith is a fictional character and the protagonist of George Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Now the kids able to get on Wi-Fi during the school day with no parental controls, no blocked sites. This can\xe2\x80\x99t be a good idea.\nIndependent says:\nApril 11, 2018 at 4:02 pm\nHmm\xe2\x80\xa6you raise what certainly sounds like a real concern. I wonder how many of the other LinkNYC kiosks and other \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d, public WiFi hotspots are within range of one or more schools.\nThat said, I believe that by a certain (still remarkably young) age, many, if not /most, can already surf the web in class with (if nothing else) the data plan on their smartphone, tablet or laptop.\nShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t students be made to surrender their phones, at least, at the start of the school-day? Was it Mayor Bloomberg who was attacked for requiring (or was it merely /suggesting/?) such an obviously common sense policy?\nan actual linknyc user says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 8:33 pm\ntwo cameras lurk atop the advertising panels, another one is just above the small tablet screen.\ni use these kiosks a fair amount and can report from experience that they are pretty rinky-dink, and ugly as hell if i say so myself. praises of these \xe2\x80\x9csmart city\xe2\x80\x9d triumphs seem to be sung loudest by those who have never used them.\nand btw i am not the stereotypical linknyc customer as profiled in other comments here, not that i should be ashamed if i was.\nphone calls via linknyc sound like garbage to the person you are calling. in my attempts to connect to the free wifi it is sometimes blazing fast but much of the time it is uselessly slow or does not work at all. half the tablet screens i encounter do not work at all. the advertising platters seem to work pretty well, these days at least. and now they are stuffing the ad screens with as much gratuitous crap as they can to get your attention, from 3rd graders\xe2\x80\x99 poetry to weirdly disembodied AP headlines that oftentimes make no sense without the story beneath them. such uninspired creative thinking has gone into this program. a lot of smart city hogwash propaganda is fueling this boondoggle and i don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how they get away with all their unearned municipal privilege. i guess that\xe2\x80\x99s why i\xe2\x80\x99m not in politics.\nEagle Eye says:\nApril 9, 2018 at 9:50 am\nRe: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6or does not work at all. half the tablet\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSentences BEGIN WITH AN UPPER-CASE (CAPITAL) LETTER!!\nSheesh, can\xe2\x80\x99t nobody writ good no more?\ndannyboy says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 8:31 am\n\xe2\x80\x9cand btw i am not the stereotypical linknyc customer as profiled in other comments here, not that i should be ashamed if i was.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYou are a generous person, by you comment.\nNot-so-much those \xe2\x80\x9cprofilers\xe2\x80\x9d.\nrobert says:\nApril 7, 2018 at 9:08 pm\nI would never ever use these and/or the WiFi service that off. They are just as dangerous to you as using any APPLE or Google product. Using an Apple product including the cloud allow them to search your usage and/or computer at any time. Google has in there term of use for Gmail, google doc\xe2\x80\x99s etc that you give them permission to access any and everything on your computer. This means they have all over your contacts, emails, sites you view etc. By using their services you are also giving them the ability to share your information with 3rd parties. This is why when you and a friend are texting/emailing about a trip to Europe and then you suddenly start getting adds about travel to Europe. The Kiosks use the same type of what\xe2\x80\x99s called a \xe2\x80\x9cnegative consent agreement/letter\xe2\x80\x9d, it says \xe2\x80\x9cthat by continuing to use their service you agree to let them do this\xe2\x80\x9d. If you connect once to their service say at 96 & B\xe2\x80\x99way and a week later you go by their Kiosk on 86 & Lex the system with quire your phone and download any new info on your phone, this is done to \xe2\x80\x9csynch up\xe2\x80\x9d your acct with them and it is done with out any notification to you.\nIndependent says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 4:47 pm\n[To replace previous]\n@ Robert, #12:\nAs the saying goes,\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying for the product, then you are the product.\nThis would apply to \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d services, such as those offered by Google and LinkNYC. The cost \xe2\x80\x94 at a minimum\xe2\x80\x94 is allowing and enabling the provider (and often any number of third-parties as well) to monitor, track and profile one\xe2\x80\x99s usage. (And, in all-too-many cases at least, to go on to sell said data to the highest bidder as well. Note that I am not making any accusations in this regard concerning either of the two aforementioned companies.)\nWith Apple, in contrast, the user actually purchases the products and services in-question by paying a fee (and by no means a discounted or bargain one). Granted, even the latter is by no means without its own privacy concerns. Nonetheless, there is a fundamental difference between the two business models and the distinction must be made.\nCarlos says:\nApril 8, 2018 at 7:29 am\nAs I understand it, their business model is to make money by selling ads on the kiosks but most of the time when I walk by I see marginally interesting trivia rather than ads so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how well that is working out for them.\nAnd I agree with others above that I find their wifi to be spotty at best.\nm.pipik says:\nApril 8, 2018 at 12:41 pm\nI want to add my expereinces to the others. The only people I have seen use these are addicts.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anyone who might live or work in the area using one.\n@yourneighbor is right, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t these in areas where people don\xe2\x80\x99t have much access to the internet?\nSo much for the liberal concept of equal access by our very \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor.\nThis contract definitely needs to be investigated for kickbacks.

Crappy free wifi is better than no wifi. Ask anyone with a small data plan. Plus, all the best cities are doing it.\nThe tablet part of it is some sort of attempt at an urban perquisite, coupled with an opportunity to advertise in the public square, which helps defray the cost of the wifi. And it impresses the tourists, which counts for something I guess. Sorta like the big touchscreen thingies in the subway.\nB.B. says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 7:13 pm\nPublic libraries have limited hours and or also limit amount of time one person can hog \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d computer/Wifi connections.\nStarbucks and other places that offer \xe2\x80\x9cfree WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d are increasingly making it \xe2\x80\x9cahem\xe2\x80\x9d uncomfortable for the homeless and or others who aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying customers to lounge around all day using the service. That and in case you\xe2\x80\x99ve not noticed Starbucks is actually opening smaller stores, which again discourages lounging about.\nThen there is the obvious (again), Starbucks and other retail/commercial places close at some point. So if you want \xe2\x80\x9cfree Wifi\xe2\x80\x9d at 1AM you need to make other arrangements.\nMany poor to low income persons have limited data plans. They use \xe2\x80\x9cfree Wifi\xe2\x80\x9d as a supplement.\nNone of this even touches tourists and other visitors to NYC\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\nNearly every other world class city in Europe, Asia or whatever has some sort of free WiFi. NYC\xe2\x80\x99s limited offerings are rather puny by some standards.\nHave to say since the porn was removed things do seem to have quieted down. Yes, you still see homeless or other persons tethered to a kiosk while huddled under blankets, but that is becoming less of an issue.\nRK says:\nApril 10, 2018 at 1:53 pm\nI\xe2\x80\x99m writing this while sitting at an AWS Machine Learning seminar discussing automated sentiment analysis and face recognition. No joke.\nMost of your technology usage is underwritten by advertising. Without this advertising, you would have to pay for services such as Google Search, free email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. If we had to pay for services, these services would not have reached the critical mass to break out of the geek-and-enthusiast niche and would not be as useful as they are now. So if you use Google, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay for the hundreds of thousands of CPUs used to complete your queries in a fraction of a second using data and technology the scale of which was unthinkable even 10 years ago, please stop complaining about advertising.\nIf you have to consume advertising, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want it to be something you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in rather than random stuff? And don\xe2\x80\x99t you think the advertisers would rather people interested in their product be the ones viewing the ads? Yes? Then it\xe2\x80\x99s a win-win-win. You get use of an unprecedented amount of intellectual capital created by some of the brightest minds in the world, hosted on a staggeringly large hardware platform, delivered via a simple user interface that even whiny UWS geriatrics can use, for free. Advertisers get to focus their ad dollars on people who are interested in them. You only need to get exposed to advertising of interest to you. Please point out the evil here.\nThis is not the Gestapo tracking your every move. No black helicopters. No evil scheme to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 do something evil. No fevered Hollywood plots. Just more efficient commerce and a more advanced society.\nOh, and stop complaining about the cameras in the Link pillars. That battle was lost long ago. Next time you go outside, look up and around and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you see at least one camera. Color, hi-def and night-vision equipped. Ever notice how crimes on the news often have surveillance footage? Not coincidence.\ndannyboy says:\nApril 11, 2018 at 7:43 am\nSteve Wozniak drops Facebook: \xe2\x80\x9cThe profits are all based on the user\xe2\x80\x99s info\xe2\x80\x9d.\nWozniak adjusted his profile on Facebook before deactivating his account and said he was shocked to see the extent of the platform\xe2\x80\x99s data collection. His announcement comes as Facebook is under fire for its potential mishandling of user data with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm.\nIndependent says:\nApril 11, 2018 at 2:44 pm\n@RK, #23:\n1.) What about cases, e.g. an ISP, where the provider of a paid product or service, already profiting amply from the full, market rate (often inflated) fees they charge, seeks to profit further at the expense of their customers by extensively and often invasively tracking, collecting and profiling their usage and then packaging and selling said data to the highest bidder?\n2.) Not everyone considers the technological advances you cite to have proven, on balance, to be a net /positive/ for society.\nTechnology is, or at least was, supposed to serve man. I am hardly the first nor the only one to contend that today, the reality is at least as often the reverse.\n3). The cameras are another matter. There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a PUBLIC place such as the sidewalks of NYC.[1]\n[1] http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf\nhttp://lindsaydobsonphotography.com/blog/photographing-people-and-children-in-public-places/\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3559975/There-is-no-law-against-photographing-children.html\nIndependent says:\nApril 12, 2018 at 12:10 am\n[to replace previous]\nSome additional points:\n1.) Using any public wireless network subjects one to both privacy as well as security risks.\n2.) I was going to ask whether there is any reason to think that whatever tracking and profiling is done by the operators of the LinkNYC kiosks, CityBridge, is\nany worse than that done by one\xe2\x80\x99s ISP or telecom provider.*\n(*NOTE: I have no affiliation with or connection to either the author of the linked article or to the site where it appears.)\nThen I read the following in the privacy policy at the LinkNYC web site:\nWe will not store your browsing history or track the websites you visit when you use your personal device to access the Services.\nAre there /any/ ISPs or telecom providers that even make a comparable claim?\n3.) RK, in Comment #23, contends that the type of tracking and profiling under discussion here (i.e., that done legally by a recognized commercial entity, in this case CityBridge) is harmless and even desirable. Even if one were to accept his arguments (and, certainly, many do /not/), what assurance does one have that the data in-question, once collected, will only be used for such purposes as outlined by RK or in the relevant terms of service?\nSuch data, which can be highly revealing and personal, can be abused in any number of ways by any number of entities. Even if one were to trust all of the authorized, original collectors of the data, what about the risk of it being stolen by rogue entities? The seemingly countless number of such instances that have been reported to-date and continue to be reported regularly would suggest that this threat remains all-too-real.\nSIGN UP FOR THE RAG\nExtra, Extra!\nUPPER WEST SIDE BLOGS\nOut Walking the DogCentral Park BloggerCity Girl WritesBeccaramaCreative DelitesFood and ThingsUpper West Side StyleMeatballs and MilkshakesTracy's New York LifeGotham Girl ChroniclesAverage JoelleWest Side WordsBloomingdale History BlogLOCAL RESOURCES\nRiverside Park ConservancyOne Stop Senior ServicesCentral Park ConservancyCommunity Board 7West End Preservation SocietyLandmark WestLivable West SideNY Historical SocietyEducation Council District 3Campaign Against HungerGale BrewerLinda RosenthalNeighborhood In The NinetiesHelen RosenthalBloomingdale Neighborhood HistoryCITY NEWS\nNew York TimesNew York Daily NewsGothamistNew York PostCity LimitsOTHER FAVORITES\nFriends of BowneNew Haven IndependentThe Lo-DownCurbedBrickUndergroundNabeWiseVanishing New YorkNew York HyperlocalEaterUntapped CitiesHumans of New Yorkfloat fixExplore Your Favorite Subject20th precinct\namerican museum of natural history\nanimals\nart\nbicycling\nbulletin\ncentral park\nclosings\ncolumns\ncommunity board 7\ncrash\ncrime\ndevelopment\ndogs\nevents\nfdny\nfire\nfood\nfree\ngale brewer\nhealth violations\nhelen rosenthal\nhistory\nhudson river\njcc\nlincoln center\nmorning bulletin\nmovies\nnypd\nopenings\npedestrian safety\nphotography\nphotos\npolitics\npublic schools\nreal estate\nrestaurants\nretail\nriverside park\nsilver stars fitness\nsnow\nsponsored\nsubway\nupper west side\nuws\nWEST SIDE RAG\nAbout\nContact Us\nSite Map\nCopyright 2011-2019 West Side Rag.

There are eleven items on the ballot this year:\nDistrict Libraries Technology Upgrades \xe2\x80\x93 $200,000\nPS 173 Auditorium Technology Upgrade \xe2\x80\x93 $150,000\nPS 48 Playground Renovation \xe2\x80\x93 $500,000\nGeorge Washington High School Weight Training \xe2\x80\x93 $80,000\nSound System for WHEELS Auditorium \xe2\x80\x93 $150,000\nDyckman Houses Building #4 Playground Renovation \xe2\x80\x93 $500,000\nDyckman Houses Building #3 Playground Renovation \xe2\x80\x93 $500,000\nDyckman Houses New Park Game Tables \xe2\x80\x93 $350,000\nDyckman Houses Community Center Outside Drainage \xe2\x80\x93 $500,000\nDyckman Houses Community Center ADA Ramp \xe2\x80\x93 $850,000\nNorthern Basketball court Wallenberg Playground \xe2\x80\x93 $535,000\nThere are three ways to vote: (1) in person at a\xc2\xa0pop up site\xc2\xa0or Monday through Friday at the Council District Office at 618 West 177th Street; (2) online at\xc2\xa0pbnyc.org/vote; or (3)\xc2\xa0visit a LinkNYC kiosk\xc2\xa0in District 10 along St. Nicholas Avenue or any of the five boroughs.\nDistrict 10 has taken part in this process since 2014. Last year the winning projects totaled over $1.1 million: laptops for low-income students at P.S.

It empowers the community to determine how to best use capital resources available to us and teaches young people the importance of civic engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez. \xe2\x80\x9cVoting has become much more accessible with the many options we now have. I invite everyone to vote between April 7th and April 15th, let their voice be heard, and their friends, family and neighbors to take part in this global initiative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticipatory budgeting is one if the best ways to get our community involved in our democratic process. What better way can there be than allowing the community decide the projects they would like to fund in their neighborhoods. Thank you Councilman Rodriguez for organizing this effort. I am sure wonderful community improvement projects will result from this process,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Marisol Alcantara.\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticipatory budgeting serves the community with a great opportunity to vote on projects based on priority as considered by residents. For a whole week the community can select their preferred projects to be funded. I commend Council member Ydanis Rodriguez for encouraging residents of district 10 to be proactive in their vote so that the 1 million dollar in capital funds are allocated in projects where the need for upgrade and improvement is vital,\xe2\x80\x9dsaid Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa.\nTo learn more about Participatory Budgeting in New York City, visit\xc2\xa0pbnyc.org.

The city Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and Citybridge \xe2\x80\x94 the organization that will install new LinkNYC kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 are applying to continue deployment of the multi-use terminals on the Upper West Side. The targeted locations are: 2 Columbus Avenue between West 59th and 60th streets;111 West 60 Street on the corner of Columbus Avenue;40 Columbus Avenue near West 61st Street;322 Columbus Avenue between West 75th and 76th streets;100 West 77th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus avenues.Thousands of LinkNYC kiosks have been installed across New York City, many of them on the Upper West Side, in a venture to replace outdated payphones. The terminals provide free wi-fi access, phone charging and assistance with directions. The terminals have also been deployed for more creative uses such as sending Valentines Day messages and functioning as bus countdown clocks.\nWhile the kiosks have their uses, there has been some negative backlash.

Braley |\nApril 11, 2018\nAs the meetings industry prepares to celebrate itself tomorrow for Global Meetings Industry Day, aiming to remind the world of the positive impact of face-to-face gatherings, New York City will glow blue tonight, April 11.\nThe Jacob K. Javits Convention Center of New York\'s glass-enclosed 15-story Crystal Palace, which is available to event managers seeking a customized lighting sequence, will turn blue for GMID. The new Pier 17\xc2\xa0-- a four-story mall opening this summer in the Seaport District with several dining options and an iPic theater -- also will participate. The Empire State Building, One Bryant Park, 4 Times Square\xc2\xa0and One World Trade Center\xc2\xa0will sport blue lights, as well.\nOn Thursday, Global Meetings Industry Day itself, more than 2,100 LinkNYC screens citywide will rotate displays of NYC & Co.\'s "Make it NYC" meetings slogan, along with MMBC and GMID logos, and in the afternoon, Vornado Realty Trust\'s Times Square billboard on the New York Marriott Marquis will display the same signs.\n"The third annual lighting of the skyline in blue on GMID eve is a unique tribute to the power of meetings," said Jerry Cito, senior vice president of convention development for NYC & Co., the city\'s convention and visitors bureau. "As both a founder of and current executive team member of MMBC, and the SVP of Convention Development here, I couldn\'t be prouder to sell NYC in this exciting time of development. With the opening of the Cornell Tech campus, the ongoing expansion of the Javits Center and numerous boutique meeting spaces emerging throughout the City, there will be added capacity for meetings delegates in 2018 and beyond. Ultimately, this will bolster spending across the five boroughs."\nMore than 100 events celebrating GMID will take place around the world tomorrow, including NYC & Co.\'s Tristate Meeting Planner event at the NFL Experience Times Square. The following is just a sampling of what\'s in store (all times are local).\nUNITED STATES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MPI Chicago Area Chapter\'s Industry Xchange 2018\xc2\xa0will begin at 4 p.m. at the city\'s new Wintrust Arena, in collaboration with the Association Forum, the Catering Executives Club of America, EDPA Midwest, IAEE Midwestern Chapter, ILEA Chicago Chapter, PCMA\'s Greater Midwest Chapter and SITE Chicago.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Meetings Industry Council of Colorado\xc2\xa0will hold a celebration starting at 1 p.m. at the Colorado State Capitol for a talk with an elected official followed by a tour of the renovated Capitol and a reception at the Sheraton Denver Downtown.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Washington, D.C., the PCMA Capital and MPI-Potomac chapters will converge for an afternoon of education, networking and advocacy [https://capital.pcma.org/event/global-meetings-industry-day-gmid/], beginning at 3:30 p.m. at the Grand Hyatt.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A Bowling, Trivia Night and Global Meetings Industry Day Celebration\xc2\xa0takes place in Scottsdale, Ariz., hosted by the MPI Arizona Sunbelt Chapter beginning at 6 p.m. at BowlMor Scottsdale.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cvent\'s Regional Leadership Summit\xc2\xa0will be held at the W Hotel in Los Angeles starting at 8 a.m., a gathering of industry leaders, practitioners and experts to discuss key trends \xc2\xa0shaping the industry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A conglomeration of industry organizations (PCMA Southeast, IAEE Southeast, MPI Georgia, GSAE, SITE and SPIN) will get together at Live! at the Battery Atlanta for GMID Spring Training at 3:30 p.m. The interactive event will explore the latest technology and industry trends.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SITE Florida & Caribbean Chapter, Sustainable Events Network Florida & Caribbean, SKAL, Greater Miami and the Beaches Hotel Association, International Live Events Association, HSMAI South Florida will hold a session on "Blockchain Disruption in Travel"\xc2\xa0at 3:30 p.m. at the Faena Hotel Miami Beach.\nINTERNATIONAL\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "The Value of Events in the Marketing Mix" is the topic being discussed in Leusden, the Netherlands, at 2:15 p.m., sponsored by the MPI the Netherlands Chapter and hosted by AFAS Software, one of the largest Dutch Software companies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Positive Impact Events in Manchester, England, is hosting\xc2\xa0a webcast at 4 p.m. on how collaboration can build a more powerful and sustainable event industry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Warsaw, Poland, the faculty of Tourism and Recreation at University of Physical Education is hosting Student Event Day, providing a series of brief lectures about the meetings industry, beginning at 10 a.m.\nClose\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by Disqus\nNewsletters\nMeeting News\nAssociation News\nSportsTravel\nHot Idea of the Day\nTech Insider\nSign Up for More ENLs\nMost Popular\nmost read\nmost shared\nHow Attrition Has Changed and What It Means for Meetings\nTSA Allows Flyers to Travel With Drug Derived From Marijuana\nThe Coolest Ice Cubes Ever\nCan Americans Still Go to Cuba?

The program allows locals, age 11 and up, to cast their vote for up to five of 11 ballot items. The top vote-getter will be fully funded, with other projects also getting funding until the allocated $1 million in discretionary cash has been fully distributed.\nMaury Schott, left, and Brooke Schooley think historic lighting would make Seventh Ave. South more neighborhood-like and \xe2\x80\x9cless like a highway.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo by Sam Bleiberg\nResidents of District 3 (Village / Chelsea / Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen) can vote online (pbnyc2018.d21.me) anywhere, including at several area polling sites, as well as at City Council Speaker Corey Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s district office and, for the first time, at LinkNYC sidewalk kiosks. Voting closes Sat., April 15. Traditional (non-online) voting can also be done at the poll sites and Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticipatory Budgeting is democracy in action,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives every constituent an opportunity to take part in the budget process.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe process started at last Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Project Expo at P.S. 41, on W. 11th St., where residents heard from project sponsors.\nJone Noveck pitched a proposal for tree guards.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the trees they plant now have a poor likelihood of survival,\xe2\x80\x9d the local resident said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may replace a tree two or three times. This would save taxpayers money.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Seventh Ave. South Alliance is proposing the installation of historic streetlights, which they say would make the street more welcoming for residents and visitors alike.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA couple of these intersections at one point were gauged among the most dangerous in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alliance member Brooke Schooley. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can provide an aesthetic feature like historic lights that can make it feel like more of a neighborhood and less like a highway.\xe2\x80\x9d The Landmarks Preservation Commission has O.K.\xe2\x80\x99d the light poles as appropriate for wide avenues in the Greenwich Village Historic District.\nEngaging youth is a goal of the City Council. This year, the \xe2\x80\x9cPB\xe2\x80\x9d voting age has been lowered from 14 to 11.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes students have to go home and might not have computers or Internet connection there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ashley, a High School of Fashion Industries student. \xe2\x80\x9cThey might have to go to libraries and waste time trying to figure out how to get things done. If it\xe2\x80\x99s at school, it\xe2\x80\x99s easily approachable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe spend most of our time on computers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malachi, a student at Quest to Learn. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes there are problems with the Wi-Fi, or our project can get deleted. If this is done properly that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAudrey Henningham, a volunteer in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s district office, advocated for a project to upgrade technology in libraries. She said the printers in the four local libraries are often out of order and the letters worn off many keyboards.\nAmong the projects are: $250,000 for real-time rider information at key bus stops district-wide; $250,000 for historic street lighting on Seventh Ave. South between Commerce, Carmine and Clarkson Sts.; $242,000 for 200 tree guards district-wide; $500,000 for a new fitness center for special-needs students at P.S. M721, Manhattan Occupational Training Center, at 250 W. Houston St.; $350,000 for tech upgrades for the district\xe2\x80\x99s public schools; $200,000 for tech upgrades \xe2\x80\x94 including new desktop computers, printers and more \xe2\x80\x94 at District 3 libraries. Other projects are in Chelsea and Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen.\nVillage poll sites include the L.G.B.T. Center, at 208 W. 13th St., and Greenwich House, at 27 Barrow St., 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sat., April 14, and Sun., April 15. There is also voting at Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s district office, at 224 W. 30th St., Suite 1206, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., from Mon., April 9 through Fri., April 13.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Daneek Miller (D-St. Albans), have until Sunday to make sure their voices are heard for their area\xe2\x80\x99s Participatory Budgeting Week.\nParticipatory budgeting allows residents to vote on which infrastructure projects will be funded by their Council member\xe2\x80\x99s budget allocation by up to $1 million.\nVoting kicked off Saturday and residents in District 27, which covers Jamaica, St. Albans, Hollis, Cambria Heights, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park and Springfield Gardens, have a chance to participate at different locations.\nBallots will be available in English, Bengali, Creole and Spanish, and if individuals want to show their support for the initiative WHAT INITIATIVE \xe2\x80\x93 EXPLAIN -on social media. they can use the hashtag #PB27 and #PBNYC.\nIn District 27 constituents can vote Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Miller\xe2\x80\x99s office, which is located at 172-12 Linden Blvd. in St. Albans. Other locations will be open on different days.\nResidents as young as 11 years old will be eligible to participate by visiting their local polling site, by completing an online ballot or using a LinkNYC kiosk.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC once again demonstrates that technology is a powerful tool for public good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samir Saini, commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re honored to work with the Council to put democracy at New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 fingertips. This year, more than 1,500 Link kiosks present that many more opportunities for residents to vote for the neighborhood projects that matter the most to them. I look forward to introducing New Yorkers to even more ways the Link platform can be used to foster civic innovation within our great city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo learn more about the process Queens residents can visit www.council.nyc.gov/pb/.\nSome of the other sites in District 27 include PS 360 in St. Albans (Tuesday), Cambria Heights Library (Wednesday), Alpha Phi Alpha Senior Center (Thursday), PS 176 in Cambria Heights (Friday) and Roy Wilkins Recreation Center (Saturday) in St. Albans.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very excited to engage all facets of our community, and empower citizens in this manner, including those previously disenfranchised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miller. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an opportunity to give all individuals, especially our young people, a chance to become stakeholders, and have a voice in the enhancement of our community\xe2\x80\x99s capital investments.

Writing helped Velez deal with her deep depression and grief after her partner passed away while waiting for a liver transplant.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted a place where I could express what I was feeling but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really sure what I was feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was hurt and angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGet Breaking News emails\nThe latest about your city, as it happens.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nHer writing group turned into a second family. And she now strives to share that support with other clients who might be intimidated by the idea of writing poetry.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe tell them to write from the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said, adding that she leaves each session with a feeling of hope.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt inspires me to come back and teach the class,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nDuke said the writing groups, which meet weekly, have been held more than 800 times since starting in 2000 and have collectively created thousands of poems.\nShe reached out to her friend, Gerry Gomez Pearlberg, a writer and poet, to help design the class. Pearlberg trained students, such as Velez, to be leaders and carry the program forward.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe respected the way we were feeling and always made us feel comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told us to write whatever we were feeling that day and it was OK.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince some of the sensitive subject matter that comes up in discussions and in writing includes violence, abuse, rape and substance abuse, confidentiality is key, Velez said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you say in the class stays in the class,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said.\nExplaining the program to funders has sometimes been a challenge because they question how it can help with HIV prevention and other health issues, Duke said. But she is able to share examples of the program\xe2\x80\x99s positive impacts, for instance, one client proudly told Duke he spent his last dollar laminating his poem rather than purchasing a beer.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a person feels respected, feels heard, feels good about themselves, they will be in a better place to take care of themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Duke said.\nBy Lisa L.

The WFP also endorsed City Council Member Jumaane Williams for Lieutenant Governor. Both Nixon and Williams are also running in their respective Democratic primaries, hoping to unseat Governor Andrew Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul.\nThe WFP endorsements came as the party itself was further fracturing, with Cuomo pulling labor unions from the party and the remaining progressive activists and advocacy groups sticking with the relatively small but influential group, and backing Nixon over Cuomo as she runs to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s left on virtually every issue. Nixon and Williams will now have the WFP ballot line for the general election, but the backing of the party and its members and member organizations are certain to boost their candidacies in the Democratic primary. It is unclear what further steps Cuomo and his allies will take to weaken the WFP and its chosen candidates, but the intra-Democratic party war is escalating.\nThe fallout from and analysis of these latest developments will headline at least the start of the week, also adding pressure on Democratic elected officials to choose between Cuomo and Nixon, as many have been hesitant to do so far. Added attention will come as state legislators return to Albany for three session days this week after the annual post-budget break. There are under two months until the end of the legislative session, and exactly 30 scheduled session days for legislative business in the capital. The return to session will also see the latest developments in the return of the Senate Independent Democratic Conference to the mainline Democratic fold.\nThat session will also be influenced by the outcomes of the special elections set to take place on Tuesday, April 24 -- one week from this Tuesday. There are 11 Assembly and Senate vacancies being filled, but the key race to watch is the state Senate race in Westchester.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a great deal of intrigue in Albany and state government and politics more broadly. There will also of course be action in New York City, where there are several City Council hearings to be aware of this week, even as Speaker Corey Johnson and a delegation of Council members continues a trip to Israel -- they return this coming weekend.\nAs always, there are a variety of events to be aware of - see our day-by-day rundown below.\n***Do you have events or topics for us to include in an upcoming Week Ahead in New York Politics?e-mail Gotham Gazette editor Ben Max:\xc2\xa0This email address is being protected from spambots.

Now, with an Internet of Thing-like paradigm, it will set up a program to monitor in real time which ones aren\'t working.\nLinkNYC has good systemwide Wi-Fi and tablet service availability, at 99.8 percent and more than 95 percent uptime, respectively. But Council Member Ben Kallos, a software developer who championed then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cReinvent Payphones\xe2\x80\x9d initiative in 2013, noticed some kiosks in his district were partially out of order, and offered Wi-Fi but not free calls.\nRELATEDNew York City Names New Chief Privacy Officer New York City to Build Nation\xe2\x80\x99s First City-Based Wireless TestbedAnne Roest Retires, NYC Hires Atlanta CIO Samir Saini as IT CommissionerDuring a conversation with interns in November as they attempted to test the Wi-Fi, Kallos told Government Technology, the idea struck him of using existing Internet protocols (IPs) such as Ping, to probe kiosk service outages in real time instead of waiting for regular, but less frequent physical inspections.\nKallos suggested the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) use IPs to improve the tracking of the free call availability, the city said in a news release.\nDoITT partnered with the New York City Council Technology Committee, chaired by Peter Koo, and with Kallos to develop a real-time monitoring system based on newly available hourly Link service information from CityBridge, the franchisee behind LinkNYC.\nThe system will intake the information into a new data set that will be available to the public in May on NYC OpenData, the city\xe2\x80\x99s open data portal, the city said.\n"This real-time, up-to-the-hour monitoring will ensure residents are able to find free phones that are working whenever they need one,"\xc2\xa0the city said in a statement.\nThe City Council\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Committee on Technology will also hear about the project in an update on LinkNYC at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 18.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the genesis, going from this very 19th-century, bureaucratic format to the Internet of Things, being able to use the Internet of Things to do an audit in real time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kallos, who emphasized that he, like so many millions of residents, relies on LinkNYC kiosks to recharge his cellphone on the way home at night, and to supplant his existing data plan.\nThe council member\xe2\x80\x99s support of the issue has included advocating in 2014 for upgrading phone booths. During his re-election campaign, his campaign office was close enough to a LinkNYC kiosk to make use of its free Wi-Fi, Kallos said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s an importance about custodianship for existing products. When I care about something, I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop caring about it when it happens. I still want it to succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Kallos said, noting that as of 2015 according the U.S. Census, more than 730,000 households in New York \xe2\x80\x94 including one-quarter of households in Brooklyn and one-third of those in the Bronx \xe2\x80\x94 did not have broadband.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving free Wi-Fi matters. LinkNYC works,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\nOther New York City officials agreed.\xc2\xa0Samir Saini, DoITT commissioner, praised Kallos for his dedication and pointed to LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s usage by more than 3.7 million people already as proof that modern monitoring is essential.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis shows how important the program has become in a relatively short time, and why it\xe2\x80\x99s paramount that we make sure Links are operating at an optimal level. In a matter of weeks, New Yorkers are going to be able to see that for themselves when we publish a new open data set showing real-time status of all the functions of each kiosk,\xe2\x80\x9d Saini said in a statement.\nKoo, the Technology Committee chairman, highlighted the "endless potential"\xc2\xa0for LinkNYC\xc2\xa0kiosks in a statement.\n"A robust monitoring and maintenance program will ensure this innovative new program lives up to its potential,"\xc2\xa0he said, thanking Kallos, LinkNYC and DoITT.\nRuth Fasoldt, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s director of external affairs, said in a statement it is \xe2\x80\x9cproud to offer a high level of service that millions of New Yorkers rely on."\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are happy to work with DoITT and Council Member Kallos, in providing additional data for the City\'s open data portal so New Yorkers can see the status of Links throughout the city,\xe2\x80\x9d Fasoldt said.\nTheo Douglas\nStaff Writer\nTheo Douglas is a staff writer for Government Technology.

Barnett\n| Posted April 18, 2018\nImage Credit:\xc2\xa0IntersectionA Google-affiliated company called Intersection is in talks with the city of Seattle to provide free Wi-Fi service, phone charging ports, and real-time information about city services at bus stops throughout downtown Seattle -- but there\xe2\x80\x99s a catch.\nAccording to New York-based Intersection, which has an office in Seattle, the kiosks provide steady revenue to cities through ad-sharing agreements while remaining \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely free for cities, taxpayers, and users.\xe2\x80\x9d The concept has its fans (New York and London have signed up), but also its critics, who have raised concerns about privacy, data sharing, and visual clutter on city streets.\nThe deal, proponents say, would provide the city with badly needed funding for transportation projects, promote digital equity for Seattle residents without access to the Internet at home or through their cell-phone provider, and enhance Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a \xe2\x80\x9cSmart City\xe2\x80\x9d that uses data to provide services more efficiently. But at a time when companies like Facebook are facing questions over their use of members\xe2\x80\x99 private information, privacy advocates are cautioning cities to pump the brakes on partnerships with big-data companies that promise something for nothing.\nRepresentatives for Intersection did not return multiple calls and emails for comment (see below for update), but according to the company\xe2\x80\x99s website, the kiosks offer advertisers a \xe2\x80\x9creal-time, localized platform\xe2\x80\x94fed by data-driven APIs\xe2\x80\x94to connect with their audiences with more relevance, in the context of their journeys throughout the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCity council member Mike O\xe2\x80\x99Brien says that when former mayor Ed Murray broached the kiosk proposal last year, the pitch was that the ad revenues could help pay for the downtown streetcar. Although the streetcar project has been\xc2\xa0put on hold\xc2\xa0because of cost overruns, the city is facing another imminent transportation funding challenge: Federal funding for the 2015 Move Seattle levy, which funds transportation projects across the city is\xc2\xa0falling short\xc2\xa0of expectations, which could lead the city to look for new revenues to offset some of the shortfall.\nMayor Jenny Durkan\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment on the record about the Link Seattle plan, but is reportedly reviewing the latest version of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy and could announce something publicly in the next few months. Mafara Hobson, communications director for the Seattle Department of Transportation, says SDOT \xe2\x80\x9cis conducting an initial research and feasibility study\xe2\x80\x9d on the plan, but adds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe work remains a preliminary concept that would require executive approval and significant legislative review and requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d (SDOT is the lead agency on the proposal because the kiosks would be located in city rights-of-way).\nO\xe2\x80\x99Brien says he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cskeptical\xe2\x80\x9d of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, both because it would require changing the city\xe2\x80\x99s sign code to allows ads on city sidewalks\xe2\x80\x94itself a major political lift\xe2\x80\x94and because of a \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing concern about how companies are capturing our data and using it\xe2\x80\x9d without our knowledge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re realizing the stupid test you took on Facebook now is in the hands of some international conglomerate that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to influence elections,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Brien says, it makes sense for cities to \xe2\x80\x9cbe very careful\xe2\x80\x9d about authorizing companies to collect their residents\xe2\x80\x99 private information.\nSpecifically, privacy advocates in other cities have raised alarms about how Intersection uses the data it collects.\xc2\xa0Although Intersection has said that it collects only \xe2\x80\x9canonymous, aggregated\xe2\x80\x9d information about its users, digital privacy advocates say that \xe2\x80\x9canonymous\xe2\x80\x9d information can be analyzed not only to extrapolate what type of ads a kiosk should display based on a user\xe2\x80\x99s search history, but to identify and track specific people based on their \xe2\x80\x9cdigital fingerprints\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a troubling capability in the hands of overzealous law enforcement, or immigration officials seeking to track down undocumented immigrants, or an employer who wants to know how many hours a perspective hire puts in at her current job.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hold government to a higher standard than businesses\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to be profiting at the expense of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d says David Robinson, a member of the Seattle Privacy Coalition who is skeptical of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s privacy claims. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the data is being stored somewhere, then eventually someone will abuse it, no matter what the policy is. If you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want people\xe2\x80\x99s data to be misused, then you shouldn\'t be collecting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShankar Narayan, policy director for the ACLU of Washington, says \xe2\x80\x9cit sounds very much as though the price of free Wi-Fi is going to be Seattleites becoming the product\xe2\x80\x94their movements, possibly the information on their cell phones, being downloaded and monetized by a company.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlthough proponents at the city argue that free Wi-Fi levels the playing field between people who have smartphones with unlimited data plans and those who don\xe2\x80\x99t, Narayan says that\xe2\x80\x99s a Faustian bargain. \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, we\xe2\x80\x99re saying people who have the means to have an unlimited mobile plan don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sacrifice their privacy to get Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdditionally, data collection opens up the possibility of data breaches, like the one at Facebook that allowed Cambridge Analytica to gather personal information on tens of millions of Facebook users.\nDevin Glaser, the policy and political director of Upgrade Seattle, a group that advocates for municipally funded broadband service, says free Wi-Fi at bus stops does almost nothing to address the lack of digital equity in Seattle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you picture a 12-year-old child needing an internet connection to finish their homework, the fact that they can have access while at the bus stop doesn\'t really cut it,\xe2\x80\x9d Glaser says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to ensure that all of Seattle\'s residents have a robust home connection, not an ad-driven boost to our Words with Friends games while we\'re waiting for the 7.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn New York City, where a consortium of companies, including Intersection, signed a 12-year contract with the city to install more than 1,000 kiosks under the brand name LinkNYC in 2016, the program has been a source of ongoing controversy. Touch-screen tablets had to be removed from the kiosks because passersby were using them to watch pornography, and privacy advocates\xc2\xa0raised questions\xc2\xa0about the company\xe2\x80\x99s retention of personal data, including browser history. Although citizen activists\xc2\xa0forced the city\xc2\xa0to revise Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy to limit how long the company would store people\xe2\x80\x99s private information, they have been unable to force the company to turn off the cameras that are located in every kiosk, recording silent video 24 hours a day. Intersection says it deletes that video every seven days unless it\xe2\x80\x99s needed \xe2\x80\x9cto investigate an incident."\nPrivacy advocates say Seattle has done a better job than most major cities, including New York, of protecting its residents from public and private surveillance. Last year, the city council passed an ordinance that gives the council some oversight over city departments\xe2\x80\x99 use of surveillance technologies\xe2\x80\x94things like the controversial \xe2\x80\x9cwireless mesh\xe2\x80\x9d system that gave Seattle police the ability to track people using wireless devices throughout the city, or the Acyclica system, which tracks travelers\xe2\x80\x99 progress through downtown using a series of devices that detect and identify people with Wi-Fi-enabled devices. (A full list of the 28 city-operated surveillance technologies identified last year is available on the city\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0website.)\nSeattle could consider beefing up its privacy ordinance to make it harder for companies to track and misuse user data. But that would require leaders to educate themselves on emerging privacy concerns proactively, the ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s Narayan says. \xe2\x80\x9cCities are not often sophisticated actors in this space\xe2\x80\x94they don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a bad deal.\xe2\x80\x9d Narayan says that before cities sign deals with companies like Intersection, they should take the time to understand how the technology operates and put the appropriate safeguards in place.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen automobiles first came in, there were no speed limits and no red lights, and people were getting run over and killed all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Narayan says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe automobile didn\xe2\x80\x99t die because we invented red lights and air bags and better brakes and put bumpers on cars. The technology better and everyone got a better deal out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUPDATE (4/20):\xc2\xa0When reached after the initial publication of this story, Intersection spokesman Dan Levitan said the company does not collect browsing data or track users across the city. He did not deny that the technological capability for such data collection does exist, but stressed that the privacy policy for LinkNYC requires that this activity does not take place in any capacity. Intersection says that its privacy policy agreement in New York City protects users from data collection activity. Those agreements, however, are made on a city-to-city basis, and the issues now being raised by privacy advocates in Seattle draw comparisons to those raised by the New York Civil Liberties Union last year.\nLevitan provided Seattle magazine with the following statement: "Intersection takes user privacy seriously and works closely with our city partners to craft strong privacy policies for all our Link deployments. We do not track or record the browsing activity of our users. Advertising on Link displays is never targeted at any individual, and there is no advertising inserted on mobile devices that connect to Link Wi-Fi. Cameras are only used for monitoring and maintenance of the structures and cannot be used for advertising or any other purpose. Footage is only accessible by law enforcement with a court order or lawful request. We are proud of the LinkNYC program, our partnership with the City of New York, and the of the service we provide to over 3.7 million users.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that Chicago has signed up for Intersection\'s Wi-Fi service, which is not the case. A previous version also mischaracterized the manner in which Intersection\'s LinkNYC is utilizing user data. Those errors have been corrected.\nRelated Content\nThe Latest Battle Over the Showbox\nBy: Erica C.

(Andrew Savulich/New York Daily News)\nAlmost 80% of the city\'s food stamp recipients are filing their applications online \xe2\x80\x94 one of several technological improvements officials say make it easier for the working hungry to get help.\n"During the last four years, we\'ve put in place strategies to fight hunger by making access to benefits for eligible families and individuals more readily available," city Human Resources Administration Commissioner Steven Banks told the Daily News. "In contrast, the federal government is prepared to dramatically cut back the federal role and support for preventing hunger."\nAdvertisement\nIn a city that receives about 24,000 applications a month for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, 79% are filed online, Banks said, and more than 1 million people have signed up for accounts with HRA ACCESS online. That means less time waiting around in offices, Banks said.\n"These are critical federal benefits that are intended to prevent hunger, and the caseload includes substantial numbers of working families and individuals for whom going to our offices to get these vital benefits means a choice between missing work and eating, and potentially losing their job in the process," said Banks, a former Legal Aid attorney who recalled his own clients languishing in long lines.\nFor those who can\'t file applications from home, the city\'s also rolled out computer banks and self-service kiosks at HRA offices to allow them to fill out forms and submit applications on their own. In addition, the city\'s launched a smart phone app to allow people to file some forms by simply taking a photo and uploading them.\n"As a Legal Aid lawyer, among the most frustrating interactions between clients and staff were, \'I submitted the document,\' \'We don\'t have it,\' \'Yes I did,\' \'But we don\'t have it,\' conversations," he said. "And the mobile app allows documents to be submitted and a record to be created."\nBanks said more than 2.5 million documents have been uploaded to the app in the year it\'s been active.\nThe city\'s just as rigorous about making sure requirements are met, he said \xe2\x80\x94 but it\'s easier on both staff and clients to provide the information online. That allows the staff to focus on clients in person who struggle with technology.\n"New Yorkers transact their business online using mobile apps and using self-service tools," Banks said. "By implementing this kind of technology for our clients, we\'re making sure that eligible clients receive the federal and state assistance to which they\'re entitled, and we\'re addressing perennial challenges with staff workload," he said.\nRecertifying benefits used to require clients to wait at home or be available to take a phone call during a four-hour window, which he said led to missed appointments, cases being closed and unnecessary hearings.\nBut the city now allows people in three boroughs, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island, to call on-demand \xe2\x80\x94 and 76% of the interviews are handled by phone at the client\'s convenience, he said. That\'s led to a 46% boost in the amount of interviews that actually get done.\nThe program will expand to Queens and the Bronx by the end of the year.\nTo boost participation, the city will launch a public information campaign about the reforms with ads in print media, on LinkNYC kiosks and in subways.\nThe benefits aren\'t just critical to those who use them \xe2\x80\x94 they also fuel the city\'s economy, he said.\n"National studies have shown that every dollar of food stamps injects a $1.70 into the local economy, so our food stamp program, our federal food stamp program provides $5.4 billion in funds to the local economy," he said. "That supports both supermarkets and the people who work in stores both large and small that sell food."\nThe advancements come while the federal government has proposed changes to SNAP that will cut benefits and eligibility for millions in the country.\ndaily news exclusives\nAdvertisement\nRecommended', b'NYC Rakes In Cash From Inmates\' Phone Calls, Advocates Say | Patch\nToggle navigation\nForest Hills\n{{ user.display_name }}\nPost\nManage posts\nMembership\nProfile settings\nEmail settings\nInvite a friend\nHelp\nContact\nLog out\nAdvertise\nLog in\nSign up\nForest Hills\nHome\nLog in\n75\xc2\xb0F\nPost\nAdvertise\nNearby\nKew Gardens-Briarwood, NY\nQueens, NY\nJackson Heights-Elmhurst, NY\nFlushing-Murray Hill, NY\nJamaica, NY\nBushwick, NY\nAstoria-Long Island City, NY\nBrownsville-East New York, NY\nBayside-Douglaston, NY\nWilliamsburg-Greenpoint, NY\nLocal News\nCommunity\nPolice & Fire\nPolitics & Government\nSchools\nTraffic & Transit\nObituaries\nWeather\nArts & Entertainment\nBusiness\nHealth\nHome & Garden\nSports\nTravel\nKids & Family\nPets\nRestaurants & Bars\nJobs\nLocal Directory\nLocalStream\nNeighbor Posts\nClassifieds\nAll\nAnnouncements\nFor Sale\nFree Stuff\nGigs & Services\nHousing\nJob Listings\nLost & Found\nOther\nCalendar\nReal Estate\nTown Info\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nGet Tickets\nSee All Places\nNearby Places\nKew Gardens-Briarwood, NY\nQueens, NY\nJackson Heights-Elmhurst, NY\nFlushing-Murray Hill, NY\nJamaica, NY\nBushwick, NY\nAstoria-Long Island City, NY\nBrownsville-East New York, NY\nBayside-Douglaston, NY\nWilliamsburg-Greenpoint, NY\nState Edition\nNew York\nNational Edition\nTop National News\nSee All Places\npolitics & government\nShared from New York City, NY\nNYC Rakes In Cash From Inmates\' Phone Calls, Advocates Say\nA City Council bill would bar the city from charging inmates to keep in touch with loved ones.\nBy Noah Manskar, Patch Staff\nApr 24, 2018 10:10 am ET | Updated Apr 24, 2018 10:21 am ET\n{{ replyButtonLabel }}\nReply\n{{ replyCount }}\nNEW YORK, NY \xe2\x80\x94 People jailed on Rikers Island shouldn\'t have to line the city\'s pockets just to call their loved ones, advocates argued Monday. A City Council bill would require the Department of Correction to provide free phone calls at city jails and give up the $5 million a year that advocates say the city earns from phone fees. "People should not have to choose between making phone calls and caring for their families," said Dwayne Lee, a formerly incarcerated community leader with the activist group VOCAL-NY. Securus, the private company that provides phone services in city jails, charges inmates fees to make phone calls. A portion of the fees goes to the city\'s general fund through a revenue-sharing agreement, Timothy Farrell, the senior deputy corrections commissioner, told the Council\'s Committee on Criminal Justice on Monday. Advocates said the fees put an unnecessary burden on incarcerated people who need to keep in touch with their lawyers or family members \xe2\x80\x94 especially since the city already offers free phone calls on its LinkNYC internet kiosks. Anna Pastoressa spent thousands of dollars to stay in touch with her son during his six-year stay on Rikers Island. She wanted to hear from him every day to be sure he wasn\'t hurt in jail, she said. "It is a terrible punishment to regular working-class people and poor people, because people that have money, wealthy people, do not go through this," said Pastoressa, a member-leader with JustLeadership USA. The DOC provides three free phone calls a week to detainees and two calls a week to inmates serving sentences, Farrell said. Calls to certain specific numbers are also always free, he said. But the calls city inmates do pay for are nearly five times as expensive as calls from state prisons, said Bianca Tylek of the Corrections Accountability Project. Securus also records phone calls, a practice that violates inmates\' rights and makes it hard for attorneys to communicate confidentially with their clients, advocates said. But Farrell said the recordings help the DOC investigate incidents and prevent future violence. Inmates\' calls to their attorneys are not recorded, officials said. The DOC is open to eliminating phone call fees, but that could require changes to the city\'s contract with Securus or a new contract altogether, officials said.\n"We would like to work with the Council to figure out how to make our telephone system as fair as possible, while maintaining the necessary services and safety features the contract provides," Farrell said.

Disney and Marvel worked with technology and media company Intersection to create a first of its kind out-of-home campaign that used roughly 1400 screens or 700 LinkNYC kiosks\xe2\x80\x94all of the kiosks below 125th street\xe2\x80\x94to make sure consumers were aware of the film, its showtimes and the closest theater.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s actually an enormous amount of digital displays,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\xc2\xa0Dave Etherington, chief strategy officer at Intersection. \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC itself is the largest employment of digital displays in any city in the world so to be able to take the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of these is pretty significant. The campaign itself was designed to drive awareness as well as ticket sales and theater visits.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The campaign kicked off last Thursday evening between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. with ads that read, \xe2\x80\x9cSee it tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d and featured the Avengers\xe2\x80\x99 logo. The next day the ads featured an integration with Moviefone, using their proprietary API, to pull in the closest theater location to the kiosk the ad appeared on as well as the next showtime for the film so that passerby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you\xe2\x80\x99re exposed to the creative you see the nearest theater playing and a countdown clock to the next movie screening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Etherington, who added that the geographically targeted ads work as \xe2\x80\x9ca call to action.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSharehttp://adweek.it/2HKU4FZ copy Kristina Monllos@KristinaMonllosKristina Monllos is a senior editor for Adweek.Popular Now1 Burger King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Whopper Detour\xe2\x80\x99 Ends Triumphant Week at Cannes With Titanium Grand Prix2 McCann\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Generation Lockdown\xe2\x80\x99 Wins Cannes Lions Grand Prix for Good3 Taco Bell Reveals the First Photos of Its Palm Springs Resort\xe2\x80\x94and They\xe2\x80\x99re Very on Brand4 Former Creative Director Sues Omnicom and TracyLocke, Alleging Sexual Harassment5 Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Air Force 1 Low Puerto Rico Shoes Illustrated a Lack of Cultural CompetencyFeatured JobsPaid Media Strategist (Work From Home)SmartBug MediaBoston, MassachusettsAccount ExecutivePop-Up Magazine ProductionsSan Francisco, CaliforniaDigital Marketing ManagerThe New SchoolNew York, New YorkClient Success ManagerADWEEKNEW YORK, New YorkSenior Marketing Strategist (Work From Home)SmartBug MediaBoston, MassachusettsSee More Jobs\nAdweek Adweek EDITOR'S PICKSCannes LionsBurger King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Whopper Detour\xe2\x80\x99 Ends Triumphant Week at Cannes With Titanium Grand Prixby David GrinerStreaming & OTTOn Tig Notaro\xe2\x80\x99s New Talk Show, Alexa Helps Her Figure Out Who Her Celebrity Guests Areby Jason LynchAdFreakBurger King Is Creating an Upside Down Whopper for Stranger Things Season 3by David GrinerCannes LionsThis Experience From P&G Luxury Beauty Brand SK-II Will Tell You How Your Skin Is Agingby Chris AriensCreativityJon Glaser and Beth Dover Share a Goofy, Gory Moment in Ubisoft\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Watch Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 Lessonby Gabriel BeltroneAdFreakPopeyes Made a Near 7-Foot Box of Chicken to Honor NBA Draft Top Pick Zion Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s Wingspanby Gabriel BeltroneCannes LionsFrom Silly to Serious, SK-II\xe2\x80\x99s Cannes-Debuted Ads Show the Brand\xe2\x80\x99s Broad Rangeby Diana PearlCannes LionsMcCann New York Takes the Grand Prix for Its Adaptive Xbox Controllers in Brand Experience and Activationby Diana PearlView Latest News > AboutContact UsMedia KitEditorial CalendarSponsor ContentJobsSubscriptionsSubscription OptionsDigital AppNewslettersFrequently Asked QuestionsCustomer ServiceAwards / Honors / EventsAwards and HonorsAdweek EventsWebinarsOn-Demand WebinarsTrophies / Awards / SealsPublicationsAdweek NetworkRSSBackissuesReprints / E-Prints\xc2\xa9 2019 Adweek, LLC. - All Rights ReservedAbout AdweekContact UsTerms of UsePrivacy Policy", b'Guest op-ed: City Hall must stop widening the digital divide, expand LinkNYC to southern Brooklyn - The Brooklyn Home Reporter\nNews\nEvents\nNeighborhoods\nBath Beach\nBay Ridge\nBensonhurst\nCarroll Gardens\nConey Island\nDowntown Brooklyn\nDumbo\nDyker Heights\nGowanus\nGravesend\nPark Slope\nRed Hook\nSheepshead Bay\nSunset Park\nDigital Editions\nAdvertise\nJoin our email newsletter to get Local Brooklyn News, Events & Offers in your inbox.\nLearn More\nBrooklyn Reporter\nBrooklyn Reporter\nNews\nEvents\nNeighborhoods\nBath Beach\nBay Ridge\nBensonhurst\nCarroll Gardens\nConey Island\nDowntown Brooklyn\nDumbo\nDyker Heights\nGowanus\nGravesend\nPark Slope\nRed Hook\nSheepshead Bay\nSunset Park\nDigital Editions\nAdvertise\nThe structure of other researchers\xe2\x80\x99 ideas p buy cheap research papers.

One glaring example is the case of the LinkNYC program.\nThe concept is a welcome one: Fast, free Wi-Fi, phone calls, device charging and access to city services, maps and directions offered through \xe2\x80\x98Links\xe2\x80\x99 placed at various locations around the city.\nYet these impressive services are only available in some areas of the city, while completely absent in others. There are currently 1,513 active Link locations, and another 241 that have been installed but are still waiting for internet hookups.\nHowever, here in southern Brooklyn, there are zero Link locations.\nIn fact, there are zero Links in Brooklyn south of a Flatbush Avenue location just outside the campus of Brooklyn College.\nThat means no fast or free Wi-Fi in Bensonhurst, Coney Island, Sea Gate, Gravesend, Brighton Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Sheepshead Bay, Borough Park, Sunset Park, Manhattan Beach, Marine Park or Midwood.\nNeighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Canarsie, East New York, and Brownsville also feature little or no LinkNYC presence.\nFailing to extend the LinkNYC program to these neighborhoods is furthering the digital divide, leaving communities full of working families and immigrants behind in a world that increasingly relies on technology, mobile devices and the internet for fulfillment of job or school-related responsibilities and daily routine tasks.\nYet, as much as technology has become a driving force in our lives, for many, the cost continues to be prohibitive.\nInternet services are not cheap, and neither are internet-capable devices. Meanwhile, internet access can be critical when looking for employment, researching for academic purposes, medical services, banking or other financial services, and news and information. Many an employer requires employees to be available electronically, too.\nI believe strongly that your zip code should not be a determining factor in what opportunities are made available to you.\nYou deserve reliable, reasonable public transit options, no matter what part of the city you live in. Your children should have the same opportunities to receive a quality education as children in any other part of the city.\nAnd in 2018, in the increasingly electronic world that, more and more, we have little option but to be a part of, free Wi-Fi and mobile services should be available in all parts of the city, not just some.\nCity Councilmember Mark Treyger represents the 47th Council District in Bath Beach, Bensonhurst, Coney Island, Gravesend and Sea Gate.\nTags:bay ridgeBensonhurstBorough ParkBrighton Beachconey islandcouncilmember mark treygerDyker HeightsGravesendguest op-edlinknycmanhattan beachMarine Parkmidwoodopinionpolitics and governmentsea gateSheepshead Baysunset parkwi-fi\nLeave a Reply\nClick here to cancel reply.\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\nRelated Articles\nBail is not supposed to be punitive, but neither should reforming bail be\nGuest Op-Ed: A 21st Century Transit System Requires Bold Leadership, New Ideas\nBrooklyn ReporterNewsletter\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Everything Brooklyn Media\nBrooklyn Reporter', b"Over 100 U.S. Mayors Join de Blasio To Defend Net Neutrality From Harlem To Hollywood\nMenu\nTop Menu\nHarlem World Magazine\nHarlem World Magazine is the #1 source in the world for living your best life and style in Harlem.\nMenu\nPrimary menu\nHome\nBeauty\nBooks\nCalendar\nCelebrity\nEducation\nEvents\nFilm\nHistory\nMusic\nReal Estate\nArchitecture\nSports\nStyle\nContributors\nCassandra\nCC Minton\nClaude Jay\nDiane Alford\nDontre Conerly\nEartha Watts-Hicks\nHosea Johnson\nKyle Fraser\nLil Nickelson\nMarc Rasbury\nMichael Andre Adams\xe2\x80\x99\nNicky Mayers\nReggie Jones\nRudy Collins\nSeitu Oronde\nTod Roulette\nUdo Salters\nWalter Rutledge\nYolande Brener\nFood\nArt\nReal Estate\nLife\nStyle\nSign-Up\nPartners\nAtlanta\nHampton\xe2\x80\x99s\nLos Angeles\nWashington DC\nAbout Us\nAdvertising Services\nCalendar\nPodcast\nSubmit A Story\nTips\nHarlem World Advisory Board\nHarlem Media Group\nThe Best\nThe Best On A Budget\nThe Best Culture & Attractions\nThe Best Food\nThe Best For Kids\nThe Best Nightlife\nThe Best Pet Services\nThe Best Places To Stay\nThe Best Shopping\nThe Best Wellness\nShop\nThe Harlem World Collection\nDonate\nSecondary menu\nPost navigation\n\xe2\x86\x90 Previous\nNext \xe2\x86\x92\nOver 100 U.S. Mayors Join de Blasio To Defend Net Neutrality From Harlem To Hollywood\nPosted on 05/02/2018\nby\nHarlem World Magazine\n\xe2\x80\x94\nLeave a reply\nLast month, Mayors Bill de Blasio, Steve Adler, and Ted Wheeler (Portland, OR) launched the Cities Open Internet Pledge to encourage mayors to take action against the repeal of net neutrality rules. Within a week of the announcement, over 20 cities signed onto the pledge agreeing to only do business with internet and telecommunications service providers that follow strong net neutrality principles. Today, 110 mayors representing over 25 million people have signed on to use their local authority to protect net neutrality.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday marks an important milestone in our fight against the Trump Administration\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to strip away the right to access a fair and open internet. Since New York City helped launch the pledge, over 100 cities have signed on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mayor de Blasio. \xe2\x80\x9cCities must continue to join together to protect an open internet for all of our people in the face of reckless deregulation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo spread awareness about the initiative, a coalition of advocacy groups led by Free Press created mayorsfornetneutrality.org. Over 79,000 people have utilized the website to ask their mayors to sign the pledge.\nIn 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality rules which allowed the FCC to prevent phone and cable companies from blocking, throttling and preferentially slowing access to websites and services.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe internet is a shared resource that is essential for businesses of all sizes and for people from all walks of life,\xe2\x80\x9d stated Mayor Keller of Albuquerque, New Mexico. \xe2\x80\x9cAlbuquerque residents need to know that vital information from government websites \xe2\x80\x93 and from all websites \xe2\x80\x93 is not being stalled or stopped for profit. Access to internet at workable speeds is critical to moving toward digital equity for all in our city.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs mayors, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of inaction,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Missouri said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to take a stand to ensure that our residents have access to the resources they need to survive in our increasingly interconnected world and that includes an open internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cNet neutrality is crucial for our startup culture in Austin and around the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking it harder for new businesses to reach their customers will stifle innovation, hurt our economy, and deeply impact our nation. It\xe2\x80\x99s critical mayors use every tool at their disposal to ensure a free and open internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we are to maximize entrepreneurial opportunities, grow quality jobs, and educate our youth, we must have net neutrality. We value net neutrality over profits for carriers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mayor Paul R. Soglin of Madison, Wisconsin.\nAn open internet is the foundation for a modern, democratic society and economy. Without net neutrality, service providers could determine who can access internet content based on fees paid, impacting equal access to opportunities for people to thrive. Repeal of the rules would also put a disproportional burden on small businesses and start-ups. Small businesses must be able to connect to customers online to compete in today\xe2\x80\x99s connected market. There are over 230,000 small businesses in New York City.\nThe FCC vote to repeal has sparked a national movement to restore open internet protections. In addition to the Cities Open Internet pledge, 33 states are considering legislation or resolutions to reject the FCC ruling and restore net neutrality protections. A congressional resolution of disapproval, which would void the FCC ruling, has gained hundreds of co-sponsors in the House and Senate, with a Senate vote expected in May.\nThe FCC plans to replace the existing rules with the Restoring Internet Freedom rule. By changing the classification, ISPs will no longer be treated like telecommunications companies and would therefore no longer be under FCC jurisdiction.\nThe City of New York has taken steps to preserve net neutrality: incorporating net neutrality provisions into the LinkNYC franchise and issuing a \xe2\x80\x9cTruth in Broadband\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0RFI to evaluate in real-time how carriers provide internet service to consumers and how to identify if they are engaging in anti-net neutrality practices.\nMayors who have signed onto the Cities Open Internet Pledge:\nMayor Bill de Blasio \xe2\x80\x94 New York, NY\nMayor Steve Adler \xe2\x80\x94 Austin, TX\nMayor Ted Wheeler \xe2\x80\x94 Portland, OR\nMayor Ron Nirenberg \xe2\x80\x94 San Antonio, TX\nMayor Sly James \xe2\x80\x94 Kansas City, MO\nMayor Mark Farrell \xe2\x80\x94 San Francisco, CA\nMayor Catherine E.

Adams announced on Tuesday the impact of his $1 million capital budget investment in Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) of participatory budgeting (PB), a democratic process in which local residents directly decide how to spend part of a public budget, which increased the number of community-driven projects funded in council districts that encompass more than 60 percent of Brooklyn. Tens of thousands of Brooklyn residents cast ballots at locations across the borough \xe2\x80\x94 including at Brooklyn Borough Hall \xe2\x80\x94 during the 2018-2019 participatory budgeting cycle voting period, which took place between Saturday, April 7th and Sunday, April 15th. Borough President Adams\xe2\x80\x99 $1 million contribution was apportioned equally to winning projects from the votes conducted by the 10 council members in the borough who are participating in PB this year.\nThis year\xe2\x80\x99s voting cycle expanded the reach to more Brooklynites as votes could be cast online at locations across the borough and at LinkNYC kiosks. Borough President Adams highlighted how the continued growth of PB in Brooklyn is helping to advance the causes of civic engagement, fiscal transparency and good government throughout the city.\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticipatory budgeting is bringing democracy back to our communities, empowering individuals to make decisions on what gets funded at the hyperlocal level,\xe2\x80\x9d said Borough President Adams. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank all of the council members participating in this year\xe2\x80\x99s process for their continued commitment to amplifying the voices of Brooklynites so our constituents have a direct say in where their taxpayer dollars get spent. From school technology to street safety, this year\xe2\x80\x99s funded projects reflect that all Brooklynites seek safer places to raise healthy children and families. Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue to advance these shared priorities and get more people involved in the PB process so that everyone has a stake in Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe $100,000 designated by Borough President Adams for PB in each participating council district expanded that council member\xe2\x80\x99s committed PB allotment, resulting in additional projects winning funding in the upcoming fiscal year:\nLaptop carts at PS/IS 157 The Benjamin Franklin Health Science Academy in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in partnership with Councilman Stephen F.

Si chiamano LinkNYC e offrono accesso a wifi, telefonate nazionali, elettricit\xc3\xa0 per ricaricare i device e altri servizi di pubblica utilit\xc3\xa0. Il tutto gratuitamente. E, udite udite, sono a costo zero anche per la municipalit\xc3\xa0.\nMODELLO FACEBOOK. Attualmente sono oltre 1.500, ma raggiungeranno presto il numero di 10 mila unit\xc3\xa0. A Manhattan si trovano a ogni incrocio e il progetto \xc3\xa8 piaciuto tanto che si sta estendendo ad altre citt\xc3\xa0. Seattle si \xc3\xa8 detta interessata, mentre Londra ne ha gi\xc3\xa0 installati 200 (si chiamano InLinkUk). Secondo quanto si legge sul sito del progetto, non solo non sono state toccate le tasche dei cittadini, ma nell\'immediato futuro l\'utilizzo di queste "centraline" generer\xc3\xa0 mezzo miliardo di dollari perla Grande Mela. Come? Con le inserzioni pubblicitarie. Per questo, soprattutto dopo lo scandalo Cambridge Analytica, i cittadini stanno drizzando le orecchie.\nLe recenti esperienze ci hanno insegnato che in assenza di costi per gli utenti, il guadagno per le aziende hi-tech sta nei dati che raccolgono dalle nostre attivit\xc3\xa0 online. E allora vale la pena guardarli pi\xc3\xb9 da vicino questi LinkNYC, non tanto per capirne funzionamento e struttura \xe2\x80\x93 che \xc3\xa8 modulare per facilitare il ricambio e l\'aggiornamento delle varie componenti \xe2\x80\x93 ma per risalire alle aziende che li hanno inventati, a chi ci guadagna e per farsi un\'idea del vero obiettivo dell\'operazione. Ma andiamo con ordine.\nNELLA GALASSIA DI GOOGLE. Il progetto nasce dalla collaborazione della citt\xc3\xa0 di New York con CityBridge, un consorzio capitanato da Intesection, di cui una quota minoritaria \xc3\xa8 di Sidewalk Labs, azienda della galassia di Alphabet, conglomerato di Mountain View. Come dire Google? S\xc3\xac, ma c\'\xc3\xa8 un altro aspetto societario da notare. Il presidente di Intersection \xc3\xa8 Dan Doctoroff, cofondatore (assieme a Craig Nevill-Manning, ingegnere dei primordi di Google e oggi direttore tecnico di Alphabet) e amministratore delegato di Sidewalk Labs. Ma qualcosa di pi\xc3\xb9 si apprende anche dalla sua biografia.\nDA FINANZIERE A URBANISTA. Doctoroff, classe 1958, ha iniziato alla Lehman Brothers ma la sua figura \xc3\xa8 cominciata a emergere negli Anni 90 quando propose un mega progetto sportivo-immobiliare in vista della candidaura alle Olimpiadi della citt\xc3\xa0. Era cos\xc3\xac convincente che il sindaco Michael Bloomberg lo volle, dal 2001 al 2008, come suo vice per lo sviluppo economico. Il suo lavoro deve essere stato apprezzato, visto che arriv\xc3\xb2 ai vertici di Bloomberg Lp dove, dal 2008 al 2014, ha ricoperto le cariche di presidente e ad. Poi la svolta.\nMentre tutto il mondo era concentrato sulle presidenziali americane che avrebbero incoronato Donald Trump, Doctoroff ha convinto Google a finanziare \xc2\xabla quarta rivoluzione\xc2\xbb nelle infrastrutture urbane. L\'idea era quella di lavorare a una citt\xc3\xa0 intelligente che operasse su sensori, videocamere, dati, algoritmi, sistemi integrati e intelligenze artificiali per risolvere i problemi strutturali delle megalopoli.\nURBANISTICA TECNOSCIENTIFICA. \xc3\x88 il sogno di un\'urbanistica tecnoscientifica, quella che il programmatore Paul McFedries spiega cos\xc3\xac: \xc2\xabLa citt\xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa8 un computer e l\'arredo urbano la sua interfaccia. Tu sei il cursore e il tuo smartphone un interruttore. Questa \xc3\xa8 la versione bottom-up della citt\xc3\xa0-computer. Ma c\'\xc3\xa8 anche la versione top-down, che \xc3\xa8 basata sulle infrastrutture. Pensate quanto migliorerebbe l\'efficienza e l\'organizzazione se il traffico, la raccolta dei rifiuti e la distribuzione dell\'acqua fossero smart\xc2\xbb.\nSOLO UNA PARTE DEGLI INCASSI ALLA CITT\xc3\x80. Ecco. Teniamo a mente quest\'utopia tecnoscientifica e torniamo a LinkNYC. Il sistema operativo \xc3\xa8 Android, se dovessero esserci altri dubbi su quanto Google sia parte del progetto. La citt\xc3\xa0 di New York, dal canto suo, offre a Intersection e ai suoi partner l\'utilizzo degli spazi pubblici in cambio dei servizi offerti dai Link e di una parte degli incassi generati dalle inserzioni pubblicitarie.\nLa citt\xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa8 un computer e l\'arredo urbano la sua interfaccia.

La fibra ottica permette addirittura di scaricare dati pi\xc3\xb9 velocemente che nella maggior parte delle case di New York e un accesso gratuito a Internet per le strade fa sempre comodo.

Uptown residents voted on 11 different projects between April 7 and 15 during this year\'s participatory budgeting cycle. This year was the first in which people could cast their ballots in person, online and on LinkNYC kiosks. The Dyckman Houses in Inwood will receive investments totaling $800,000 to improve a playground in the development and for an ADA-accessible ramp for the development\'s community center. The remaining $200,000 will be spent on technology upgrades at libraries throughout Washington Heights and Inwood. City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez said all 11 projects up for funding were "much needed investments" and he will look into securing funding for those that didn\'t win any participatory budgeting money.\nHere\'s a full list of this year\'s participatory budgeting projects (winners in bold): District Libraries Technology Upgrades: Estimated cost $200,000P.S. 173 Auditorium Technology Upgrade: Estimated cost $150,000P.S. 48 Playground Renovation: Estimated cost $500,000George Washington High School Weight Training: Estimated cost $80,000Sound System for WHEELS Auditorium: Estimated cost $150,000Dyckman Houses Building #4 Playground Renovation: Estimated cost $500,000Dyckman Houses Building #3 Park Renovation: Estimated cost $500,000Dyckman Houses New Park Game Tables: Estimated cost $350,000Dyckman Houses Community Center Outside Drainage: Estimated cost $500,000Dyckman Houses Community Center ADA Ramp: Estimated cost $850,000Northern Basketball Court Wallenberg Playground: Estimated cost $535,000Photo by ShutterstockSubscribe\nBack to the Washington Heights-Inwood Patch\nMore from Washington Heights-InwoodUp next on Washington Heights-Inwood Patch\nLegal E-Bikes Won\'t Be Allowed In NYC Bike Lanes, De Blasio Says 3h\nLong-Range Summer Forecast Released For NY 2h\nThis Dream Pillow Makes Bedtime Fun For Kids 4d\nRead more local news from Washington Heights-Inwood\nWhat are Featured Events?\nFeatured Events are paid listings by users and receive priority placement on Patch, on our social pages and in our daily newsletters.

LEWISMay 17, 2018\nSHARE:\nNew York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications Commissioner Samir Saini is just two months into his new job, but he already has big plans for his department. In an interview with City & State, Saini described how he plans to reshape the department while continuing to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s goal of providing broadband for all New Yorkers, from free public Wi-Fi to home broadband service. Saini also weighed in on cybersecurity in the city and his own transition from his previous role as Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s chief information officer.C&S: How is the OneNYC initiative to bring broadband to all New Yorkers going?SS: It\xe2\x80\x99s going well. There are different parts to the program. The first part is the effort to bring broadband on our streets, which is the public Wi-Fi, the high-speed public Wi-Fi strategy. And that is largely tied to the LinkNYC kiosks. So the Link deployments, things are going very well. We just briefed the City Council on this and we have another briefing as part of a budget hearing next week on it. But we have, as of today, about 1,500 Links, active Links deployed delivering, from what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting on average, about 300-350 megabit per second up and down with a 200-foot radius range from each Link. So we have 1,500 Links deployed, scattered across the boroughs and that\xe2\x80\x99s going quite well. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 3.5 million active subscribers using free, high-speed public Wi-Fi from the Links. And I think the other metric I just saw is we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing double-digit growth in the number of subscribers every year since we deployed the Links. So Link is going well. That\xe2\x80\x99s one piece.C&S: And the other pieces?SS: The other piece is broadband in the home. That\xe2\x80\x99s also moving forward. So broadband in the home is largely driven by DoITT\xe2\x80\x99s role to administer a set of franchise agreements. There are eight franchise agreements with cable providers. I guess the big issue there is broadband in the home, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really largely provided by two suppliers in the city: Verizon Fios and Charter/Spectrum. And what I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be seeing from DoITT as part of a strategic plan we\xe2\x80\x99re going to launch very soon, before July 1, is new strategies we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deploy to help accelerate the deployment of affordable broadband in the home, and the equitable distribution of it because there are parts of the city that don\xe2\x80\x99t have broadband. The Mayor\'s Office of the Chief Technology Officer just issued a broadband report two weeks ago that\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite enlightening. Some of the highlights over here are that, No. 1, roughly 31 percent of New Yorkers don\xe2\x80\x99t have broadband in the home today, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the equivalent to the entire population of the city of Houston. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. There\xe2\x80\x99s also issues around affordability for the current broadband services that are offered. And I think the obvious issue is there is a minimal level of choice for broadband. So all these things we\xe2\x80\x99re tackling, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see this in the strategic plan, ways in which we\xe2\x80\x99re going to change this game to deliver more equitable, affordable broadband to more New Yorkers to really hit the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s commitment of broadband for all New Yorkers by 2025.\nsamir-saini-headshot-submitted.jpg\nAlt Text:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiTitle Text:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiCaption:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiDescription:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiImage Credit:\xc2\xa0Submitted\nC&S: What can you tell me about ongoing difficulties with Charter/Spectrum? In what ways are they possibly violating their franchise agreement with the city?SS: There were two audits that we conducted against Spectrum. One was an audit that was financially related around evaluating how revenue was being calculated and generated. And the second audit was more on labor. And really the audits were meant to ensure and validate that Charter was in fact complying to the letter of the franchise agreement we have in place with them. So that\xe2\x80\x99s all public knowledge. On the financial audit, we asked for a bunch of financial data from Charter. They provided it ... and we\xe2\x80\x99re analyzing it. So that\xe2\x80\x99s in process. On the audit regarding whether they violated any labor issues, we made some initial findings, however there\xe2\x80\x99s other concerns from other entities around whether this is a violation of labor provisions within the franchise agreement that are still pending a final determination.C&S: You\xe2\x80\x99re fairly new to the job. What has your transition been like and what do you consider to be your most important role?SS: I\xe2\x80\x99m still two months in. But really, I\xe2\x80\x99ve broken down our core objectives into three parts. The first is going all-in into achieving digital equity for all New Yorkers. Digital equity implying equitably distributed, affordable broadband in every home, on every street, in every borough. The second one is really a focus on DoITT as a shared services provider. DoITT provides a set of IT services to serve our internal agencies. We have over 100 agencies that we support in different ways. So the first objective I\xe2\x80\x99ll have for our agency is to really transform ourselves more fully and entirely into operating like an external service company. Less a call center, internal service order taker. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a big cultural shift for us, but the idea is to really start transforming how we interact with agencies: treat them like customers, have a menu of services that are really easily understood and explainable and measurable. So it\xe2\x80\x99s really running our internal shop better than we do today and then transforming ourselves from order taker to a service management orientation.\nThe second objective is really around relooking at the services we provide to the agencies. We provide about 60 high-level services today \xe2\x80\x93 relooking at these 60, asking our customers, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat services do you want from us?\xe2\x80\x9d And then optimizing the service portfolio to align to the needs of the agencies today and what they\xe2\x80\x99ll need over the foreseeable future. This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened in a long time. Up to this point, DoITT has built its service portfolio based on random requests from different agencies. If you wanted a pizza, DoITT would figure out how to make a pizza and give you a pizza. If you wanted a hamburger, we\xe2\x80\x99d figure that out and give you a hamburger. If you wanted a steak, we did that. Now we have a kitchen and a bunch of chefs that can make all sorts of stuff. But the question is, should we? Or do we want to be a pizza joint? What do we actually want to be? It\xe2\x80\x99s a good problem to have because we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a lot of relationships and we have a wide menu, but it\xe2\x80\x99s now becoming a point where we want to be more strategic about what we want to put on our menu based on what really our customers want from us \xe2\x80\x93 especially if people aren\xe2\x80\x99t ordering burgers anymore.C&S: Cybersecurity has been a very large concern recently, especially with the upcoming elections. What is the city doing to shore up its defenses against cyberattacks?SS: There was a press release from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office announcing the preliminary budget that\xe2\x80\x99s going to the City Council for review over the next few weeks. In that budget is an inclusion for over $40 million dedicated for Geoff Brown and the new cyber command unit that\xe2\x80\x99s been set up. The cyber command unit, we call C3 under the citywide (chief information security officer) Geoff Brown, reports directly into the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office, the deputy mayor of operations, not to me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing because security is such a huge world these days that it requires its own agency, its own dedicated focus and that\xe2\x80\x99s where that lives. So the biggest thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is put money to it, and the money is really for staff and for tools to strengthen the city\xe2\x80\x99s ability to detect, to respond, to prevent threats from happening in the first place. It also is investments to ensure that we can continuously proactively check to find holes in the environment if any exist and close them before they\xe2\x80\x99re ever exploited by a bad actor externally. And so we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling really good about it. It takes investment and the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed budget provides exactly that.C&S: Is that different than other cities?SS: It is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other city that has that structure. Coming from me, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing because New York City isn\xe2\x80\x99t like any other city. The sheer complexity of what we do and how visible we are externally warrants that cybersecurity be its own entity and have its own separate investment and funding and resources. So I think the executive order Mayor de Blasio issued to create this organization last summer was absolutely the right move. And I think New York should feel really good that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing what other cities do. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking cybersecurity so seriously, we created a whole agency, and incremental new funding dedicated to it to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re safe.C&S: A couple months ago, there was a huge cyberattack that crippled Atlanta. Do you think that having a New York City approach to cybersecurity could have prevented or at minimized the damage of that attack?SS: I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I mean, the reality of what happened in Atlanta and also what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in other cities is just not being, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hitting the news unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in the CIO circuit, is that those kinds of threats, especially that one ... can\xe2\x80\x99t be prevented. (Editor\'s note: After this interview was published, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications clarified that Saini meant\xc2\xa0that such threats are "very hard to prevent.")\xc2\xa0The key is to have an administration that prioritizes cybersecurity. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it that way. And investments in cybersecurity in particular are really critical regardless of how it\xe2\x80\x99s structured. In Atlanta, I think Mayor (Keisha Lance) Bottoms publicly said that she had not made cybersecurity a priority. That\xe2\x80\x99s her words. But now, after the attack, it is her No. 1 priority. So I think the mayor is doing absolutely the right thing, which is way before, this is last year, before the Atlanta attack and actually several other attacks that occurred in other cities affecting critical infrastructure, public safety infrastructure, transportation infrastructure. California got affected. He saw the writing on the wall and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do this differently,\xe2\x80\x9d which is where C3 was born.C&S: You were CIO in Atlanta before coming to New York City. How different has it been to come from a place where, as you said, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t initially a priority to a place where it is?SS: Part of why I had left is first off, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually from New Jersey. So, in part, this was a move home. But the other is, there was a leadership change happening in Atlanta, there was a new mayor coming it. It was a logical time for me to depart. But also, there was minimal \xe2\x80\x93 I felt like Atlanta had hit a point where they were not investing as much as I would have wanted them to in moving on a number of areas, scaling out smart city initiatives we had, but also in the cyber space. So it was really a mixed bag of reasons, but moving here to New York, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a real blessing because I think this city and this mayor really understands and values IT. Not to say they didn\xe2\x80\x99t in Atlanta, but certainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal here. In large part I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because the operations of New York City are so complex and affect so many people that technology plays an even more critical role in the delivery of the services to the 8.7 million people that live here, less so the 500,000 people that live in Atlanta. So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot more focus and dependence on it, and a lot more investment and appreciation for IT and our services.C&S: And you said the kind of attack that happened in Atlanta isn\xe2\x80\x99t really preventable. Is it a concern that it could happen in New York City?SS: Yes. There\xe2\x80\x99s multiple types of cyberattacks that occur all the time. So I would be the first to tell you, and no one could disagree with this, no city, no state, no private sector entity is immune from any of these. Period. If anyone thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re well-protected, well, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that publicly because they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be a target. If you talk to the cybersecurity experts out there, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 that the game now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about investing in services to protect yourself from ever having an attack. Everyone needs to accept that there will be an attack. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of when. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of how bad. And the question really will be, how ready are you, as a city or as a private sector company, to detect it and remediate it, and to strengthen your defenses so if it happens again, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be as bad, or that kind of attack won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. It\xe2\x80\x99s about containment and response and then strengthening your defenses next time. No one is immune. It just so happens that Atlanta got hit, but when was the last time Atlanta was hit? Never. Because we did several other things, at least over the course of my time there, where we could have gotten hit 10 times because we had legacy infrastructure and all sorts of holes. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those things where you\xe2\x80\x99re never 100 percent safe. Nobody is 100 percent safe from a cyberattack. Anyone who says they are, I would worry about.\nRelated Stories\nNew York CityA look at DoITT\'s new Text-to-911 emergency response initiativeBy GRACE SEGERS\nTechnologyThe next frontier: A Q&A with DoITT Commissioner Anne RoestBy FRANK G.

No one knows why, and as far as anyone at LinkNYC can tell, it was not part of a promotion. Like many horror scenes, everything started out fine.\n"Initially I thought I had just passed two Mr. Softee trucks in a row, since I heard it from block to block," Steve Burges, a bike courier, told Gothamist. "Then I realized I was hearing it played on several consecutive blocks from the LinkNYC Kiosks, and it felt very odd."\nBut as Burges continued passing the kiosks\xe2\x80\x94nearly ten in all\xe2\x80\x94each of them "playing the same jingle seemingly in unison," the odd scene turned bloodcurdling. "Something was off because of the slow rhythmic the song, and it was really eerie," he added.\nThanks for letting us know. Our team is looking into this further. If you know what specific Links you hear this on, would you mind DMing us that information?\xe2\x80\x94 LinkNYC (@LinkNYC) May 23, 2018\nCarla Giarusso first heard the eerie jingle outside of her office on 43rd Street and 3rd Avenue, and soon noticed two more in the area. "My initial reaction when I heard the first one was wtf/laughter but then I realized it was a few more and thought either 1/ the end is nigh or 2/ we they were hacked (ha) and then of course I naturally assumed it must be the Russians," she told Gothamist.\n"Then I stopped laughing when I remembered that sonic incident in Cuba last year and figured I may as well see if the city was aware...they seemed as perplexed [as I was]."\nConcerned pedestrians who messaged LinkNYC on Twitter were told that the company is "currently looking into this," and would reboot the tablets for the time being.\nAsked about the creepy jingle, a LinkNYC spokesperson issued this statement: "LinkNYC serves New Yorkers in many important ways\xe2\x80\x94providing free wi-fi to more than 4 million users, free phone calls, device charging, and more\xe2\x80\x94but unfortunately, we don\'t serve ice cream. Once we were alerted to the Mr. Softee jingle, we immediately rebooted the tablets to end the song. Sorry if anyone wandered towards the kiosks looking for soft serve!"\nWill this reboot be enough to stave off the coming war between man and machine and ice cream? Is this the latest gambit in the increasingly hostile dessert truck turf battle? Or is it all just some sort of Pavlovian psychological experiment, a way for the city to test its powers of conditioning over New Yorkers?\nWe\'ll let you know when we find out\xe2\x80\x94in the meantime, it\'s a perfect day for a chocolate-vanilla swirl.\nReporting by Jen Chung.\n#ice cream\n#linknyc\n#midtown\n#mister softee\nDo you know the scoop? \xc2\xa0 Comment below or Send us a Tip\nFeatured in Arts & Entertainment\nRead More In:\nNews\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nPopular\nDashed Arrow\nBack to Top\nGothamist\nSend Us a Story Idea\nFollow Us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nGothamist is a website about New York City news, arts and events, and food, brought to you by New York Public Radio.\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nParty Confetti\nDashed Arrow\nSign up for our newsletter!

Rjsswf8 / CC BY-SA 3.0\nEarlier this week, several New Yorkers noticed a strangely familiar noise emanating from midtown LinkNYC kiosks. Gothamist reports that as many as ten kiosks along Third Avenue, which provide free wi-fi access across the city, began all trilling simultaneously with the the iconic Mister Softee jingle. Normally the music is a happy announcement of warm weather and ice cream for sale. But it sounded off and slowed-down from the usual, twinkling song.\nAt first, onlookers thought they might be hearing distant trucks. But locals, such as bike courier Steve Burges, soon discovered that it was indeed coming from kiosks, and that \xe2\x80\x9csomething was off because of the slow rhythmics [of] the song, and it was really eerie,\xe2\x80\x9d as he described to the paper.\nThe haunting jingle doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be part of a promotion or a prank: On Twitter, LinkNYC assured people that, no, they were \xe2\x80\x9cnot hacked,\xe2\x80\x9d and they rebooted the system to stop the music. So what really happened? It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say at this point, as no one has claimed responsibility. But it\xe2\x80\x99s curious that a city-backed infrastructure project is blasting a jingle that, a little over a decade ago, city administrators wanted to silence.\nBack in the early to mid aughts, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought to stamp out Mister Softee\xe2\x80\x99s song once and for all. The battle against the ice cream jingle was a part of the Bloomberg administration\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown on noise in the city, dubbed Operation Silent Night. The ordinance took on stereos, construction projects, barking dogs, the hum of air conditioners, and, yes, the sound of approaching ice cream.\nIn 2004, Bloomberg cited scores of complaints rolling into the city\xe2\x80\x99s 311 hotline about the jingle. New Yorkers quickly disagreed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d Teniqua Frontis told the New York Daily News. \xe2\x80\x9cThe jackhammers, the motorcycles, the cars. Those are the problems.\xe2\x80\x9d Mister Softee representatives protested, too, saying that silencing the call would decimate their business. Some lawmakers weren\xe2\x80\x99t totally onboard, either; one told Bloomberg that he would \xe2\x80\x9ctraumatize a lot of children in this city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA summer classic. Alison Fayre / CC BY 2.0\nMister Softee\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive song was allowed to continue after all in 2005. The administration struck a compromise that stated the jingle must cease playing when trucks stop moving. Bloomberg continued to take shots at Mister Softee in ensuing years, but the distinctive song lives on\xe2\x80\x94spilling out of ice cream trucks and LinkNYC kiosks alike. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence, or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a frosted middle finger to the former mayor\xe2\x80\x99s war on ice cream. But either way, the tune undeniably signals that summer is now in full swing.\nGastro Obscura covers the world\xe2\x80\x99s most wondrous food and drink.\nSign up for our email, delivered twice a week.\nice creammusicfood\nRead Next\nHow the U.S. Army Botched Feeding Its Female Soldiers in WWII\nRecent Stories\nThe Forgotten Trans History of the Wild West\nIt was a frontier in more ways than one.\nThe Scholar Mapping America's Forgotten Feminist Restaurants\nChallenging patriarchy, one eatery at a time.\nAnimating Oregon\nAn ad campaign from Travel Oregon takes you on a fantastic voyage through the state.\nSponsored by Travel Oregon\nRelated Stories\nstory\naco\nCan Nigerian Drumming Teach You to Pick the Perfect Watermelon?\nAcoustics is here to help you find ripe produce.\nMay 23, 2019\nstory\nafrica\nTo Revive This Royal Music, Ugandans Had to Grow New Instruments\nBigwala was once illegal, and only two master practitioners remained.\nMarch 29, 2019\nstory\nlivestock\nThe Spellbinding Swedish Song That Calls Cows Home\nFor centuries, herdswomen have lured cows with haunting melodies.\nMarch 05, 2019\nstory\ndinner party\nThe Pyrotechnic Ice-Cream Parades of the Nobel Prize Banquet\nOnce, there was even an official ice cream.\nOctober 16, 2018\nMore Food & Drink\nStory\nSweets\nNew York Charlotte Russe\nThe dainty, cream-filled specialty is on the brink of extinction.\nAdded by Leigh ChavezBush\nStory\nDrinks\nNutcracker\nThis cocktail is a New York City summertime staple, albeit an illegal one.\nAdded by Rose Annis\nStory\nSweets\nPickle Soft Serve\nThe briny, refreshing ice cream acts as a cooling chaser to spicy meals.\nAdded by natantman\nStory\nDrinks\nEgg Cream\nA fizzy, chocolate drink that harkens back to the days of Brooklyn soda fountains.\nAdded by rachelrummel\nRecent Stories\nThe Forgotten Trans History of the Wild West\nIt was a frontier in more ways than one.\nThe Scholar Mapping America's Forgotten Feminist Restaurants\nChallenging patriarchy, one eatery at a time.\nAnimating Oregon\nAn ad campaign from Travel Oregon takes you on a fantastic voyage through the state.\nSponsored by Travel Oregon\nEnjoying This Story?\nGet our latest, delivered straight to your inbox by subscribing to our newsletter.\nSubscribe to our newsletter and get our latest, sent right to your inbox.\nSubscribe\nThanks for subscribing!

This kiosks is located on Fourth Avenue and 33rd Street. EBrooklyn Media file photo by Paula Katinas\nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s technology revolution is passing Bensonhurst by.\nNeighborhood officials are miffed that the city\xe2\x80\x99s much-touted LinkNYC program, which makes free Wifi available to residents via sidewalk kiosks, is nowhere to be seen on local streets.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would like to have them,\xe2\x80\x9d Community Board 11 District Manager Marne Elias-Pavia said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would provide a valuable service to the residents of our community. Not everyone can afford to pay for high-speed internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn addition to free WiFi, the LinkNYC portals offer users free phone calls, easy access to the 911 and 311 systems, maps and social services platforms through a LinkNYC network. The kiosks are also equipped to serve as charging stations for people seeking to charge their cell phones and other mobile devices.\nMore than 3.5 million people have used the free WiFi since the first LinkNYC stations were installed in 2016, according to city officials. The 9.5-foot-tall kiosks contain 55-inch high-definition screens on both sides. The panels replaced the old pay telephones that used to line the sidewalks.\nThere are currently more than 1,600 LinkNYC kiosks on New York City sidewalks, including an abundance of them in trendy, upscale Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights and Williamsburg.\nThe city plans to install 7,500 LinkNYC kiosks over the next several years.\nIn Park Slope, the kiosks also list the arrival times of buses at local bus stops. The bus time information was installed under a pilot program.\nOther neighborhoods, like Sunset Park, have also been linked up to LinkNYC. Along a 13-block stretch of Fourth Avenue from 24th Street to 37th Street, there are six kiosks.\nResidents seeking to vote for capital budget projects in their neighborhoods as part of the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s Participatory Budgeting program could find ballots on their local LinkNYC kiosks.\nBut there is a dearth of the tall, sleek-looking technology stations in Bensonhurst and other Southwest Brooklyn communities, according to local elected officials, who are calling on the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, the agency responsible for the program, to rectify the situation.\nCouncilmember Justin Brannan posted a map of Brooklyn on his Twitter page to illustrate the lack of LinkNYC in Southwest Brooklyn.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just not fair that the wealthiest communities in New York City have an abundance of free WiFi and neighborhoods like Bensonhurst and Dyker Heights don\xe2\x80\x99t have a single LinkNYC WiFi kiosk. Going forward, LinkNYC must fulfill its franchise agreement and provide kiosks to underserved areas from Bay Ridge to Coney Island to Brownsville,\xe2\x80\x9d Brannan told this paper via email.\nOn his Twitter page, Brannan called Southwest Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x9ca WiFi-free desert.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCouncilmember Mark Treyger said he is annoyed at the absence of LinkNYC portals in his district.\nTreyger charged that the haphazard rollout of the program is turning New York into a city of technology haves and have-nots.\n\xe2\x80\x9cInternet services are not cheap, and neither are internet-capable devices. Meanwhile, internet access can be critical when looking for employment, researching for academic purposes, medical services, banking or other financial services, and news and information. Many an employer requires employees to be available electronically, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in an op-ed in this newspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe strongly that your zip code should not be a determining factor in what opportunities are made available to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMayor Bill de Blasio first announced a plan to bring free WiFi to New York City streets in 2014 with a promise to include all five boroughs. The city hired a consortium called CityBridge to install the kiosks.\nOfficials from the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications briefed CB 11 on the plans in 2014 and told the board they were scouting possible locations on Kings Highway, 86th Street, New Utrecht Avenue and 18th Avenue. \xe2\x80\x9cBut since that time, we have received no updates,\xe2\x80\x9d Elias-Pavia said.\nThe Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications issued a statement in response to inquiries from this paper.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC is a pioneering and successful initiative, already connecting more than 3.9 million New Yorkers and visitors to superfast WiFi, free calling, and more\xe2\x80\x94at zero cost to taxpayers. Since the public launch in 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs with thousands more set to be deployed over the next few years. Link deployment follows the installation of high-speed fiber optic cables along corridors through the city. We look forward to each of the thousands more that will hit the streets in the next few years, including those in Southwest Brooklyn,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads.\nLeave a Reply\nClick here to cancel reply.\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\nRelated Articles\nDime Savings Bank Serving Williamsburg Brooklyn Since 1864\nAdam Suerte Paints Urban\nBrooklyn\nBrooklyn ReporterNewsletter\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Everything Brooklyn Media\nBrooklyn Reporter', b'The missing Links as sidewalk WiFi kiosks come up short - New York Daily News\nSkip to content\nTopics\nxml:space="preserve">\nSubscriber Services\nManage Subscription\nEZ Pay\nDelivery Issue\nSubscriber Terms\nNew York\nNYC Crime\nBronx\nBrooklyn\nManhattan\nQueens\nEducation\nObituaries\nWeather\nSports\nYankees\nMets\nGiants\nJets\nKnicks\nNets\nRangers\nIslanders\nFootball\nBasketball\nBaseball\nHockey\nSoccer\nMore Sports\nI\'d Click That\nOdds\nGolf\nNews\nCrime\nU.S.\nPolitics\nBill de Blasio 2020 Campaign\nWorld\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTV\nMusic\nBroadway\nGossip\nLifestyle\nHealth\nEats\nGames\nViva\nBest Reviews\nTravel Deals\nOpinion\nPhotos\nHoroscopes\nDaily\nE-Newspaper\nAutos\nCovers\nSpecial Sections\nClassifieds\nPublic Notices\nBranded Content\nPaid Partner Content\nPaid Content By Brandpoint\nTAG disclosure\nSearch\nxml:space="preserve">\nNew York\nSports\nNews\nEntertainment\nOpinion\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOpinion\nThe missing Links as sidewalk WiFi kiosks come up short\nBy Editorials\n| NEW YORK DAILY NEWS |\nMay 30, 2018\n|\n4:00 AM\nNot as advertised. (Robert Sabo/New York Daily News)\n"The deal struck by Mayor de Blasio to bring free Wi-Fi to neighborhoods across the city sounds too good to be true," we wrote three and a half years ago, as a caveat on our praise of the shiny monoliths soon to dot New York\'s sidewalks.\nThe prediction turned out to be accurate. Tuesday, the consortium installing the LinkNYC kiosks where dead pay phones once stood told the city it\'s been unable to deliver what it promised.\nAdvertisement\nThe deal is getting restructured: Instead of placing 7,500 machines around the five boroughs by 2023, CityBridge will now get until 2025, with almost all of them bearing ads. It gets more time to pay the city in full, too.\nAdjustments in deals between private companies making use of public space happen \xe2\x80\x94 but why did these changes have to be rushed? The de Blasio administration gave notice of the Franchise and Concession Review Committee meeting the day before the Memorial Day weekend. A vote was scheduled for the next business day, Tuesday.\nTo get its revisions through, the city had to table one proposed revision: letting kiosks be put next to bus shelters, which have their own ads.\nLinkNYC, which once looked like a winner, is now shaping up as a mixed bag. When the kiosks work, they supply a fast, free Internet connection, via a built-in tablet and to your own device over Wi-Fi. But six months after they debuted, the on-board browsers were turned off because some folks were watching, well \xe2\x80\x94 how to put it? \xe2\x80\x94 films featuring the likes of Stormy Daniels.\nWe asked: Why not just deactivate the video function, rather than pulling the plug on the whole browser? We never got an answer.\nAdvertisement\nRecommended', b'LinkNYC Kiosks Still Possessed By Mister Softee Jingle, Still Creeping Out New Yorkers - Gothamist\nmenu content begins\nGothamist\nDonate\nNews\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nPopular\nFollow Us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nSearch this site\nSearch\nSearch\nSend us a Story Idea\nNYPR\nView All Brands\nCaret Down\n\xc2\xa9 2019 New York Public Radio.

Since then, others have encountered multiple possessed kiosks, including two near 67th Street and Broadway, which Richard Anderson spotted on his lunch break on Wednesday afternoon.\n"It was definitely creepy, even once I realized it was coming from the LinkNYC things again," Anderson told Gothamist.

"This is definitely someone\'s form of protest," said one member of the anti-surveillance group Rethink Link. "It\'s highlighting the dangers of the whole march to the Internet of Things."\nWhether this is a political protest, harmless prank or sweet-toothed robot takeover is, at this point, unknown.

Those were some of the wary reactions of New Yorkers when the first LinkNYC booths started arriving in the city two years ago, part of a sweeping plan to replace old pay phones with 7,500 kiosks offering super-fast Wi-Fi and other digital services.\nJudging by the volume of usage at more than 1,600 kiosks installed so far, however, New Yorkers have started to embrace them as communications hubs.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSince launching, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already had more than 4 million people connect to our Wi-Fi, which is larger than the population of Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ruth Fasoldt, director of external affairs at LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cWe also offer free phone calls anywhere within the U.S., map functions on our tablets, access to 311, a 911 button, USB phone charging \xe2\x80\xa6 we do all of this and it\xe2\x80\x99s all paid for by the advertising on the sides of the links,\xe2\x80\x9d Fasoldt added.\nIn 2018 so far, Brooklynites have made more than 200,000 phone calls on the 236 kiosks installed in the borough so far. The most popular kiosk in Brooklyn, in terms of the number of people connecting to the Wi-Fi, has been one on Atlantic Avenue near Barclays Center. That Link, in the month of April, had more than 50,000 devices connect to it, while people across all of Brooklyn spent 32.9 million minutes on the system\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi.\nWe tried it for ourselves: LinkLocal is a free ad program for small businesses and organizations (Photo by Steve Koepp)\nLinkNYC is constantly developing new programming for the eye-catching, 55-inch digital displays on both sides of the boards. Today LinkNYC and the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications\xc2\xa0 (DoITT) launched a collaboration with local artists to celebrate \xe2\x80\x9clife, beauty, and culture in New York City.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the artists involved, Julia Rothman of Brooklyn, said she\xe2\x80\x99s thrilled to see her art pop up all over the city. \xe2\x80\x9cI really like that they only appear for a short time on the screen before it flips to the next image, so it feels like you caught a quick glimpse of something special,\xe2\x80\x9d Rothman said in a press release announcing the program.\nLocal small businesses and organizations can take advantage of LinkNYC kiosks as well by signing up for a free advertising program called\xc2\xa0LinkLocal. By filling out a template online, users can request a month of rotating display time on two kiosks of their choice.\nEarlier this year, the City Council partnered with LinkNYC to launch Participatory Budgeting on the kiosks, enabling citizens another conduit for casting votes on how the city spends $1 million of the public budget. Anyone who lived in a participating district could approach a Link in any neighborhood and vote on the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s tablet.\nIn a program announced this week, artists including Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Julia Rothman will have their work displayed on the big screens\nLinkNYC, the largest network of its kind in the world, got its start in 2014 when the de Blasio Administration put out a call for proposals to repurpose the city\xe2\x80\x99s payphone infrastructure.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNew York knew that they had thousands of pay phones throughout the five boroughs sitting on prime real estate, not really being used by New Yorkers anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d says Fasoldt. \xe2\x80\x9cSo they wanted to find a way to really improve New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 lives and make this a part of their smart-cities initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d which involves deploying technology to make the city a better place.\nThe 12-year franchise was awarded to CityBridge, a consortium of experts in tech, media, and connectivity. CityBridge, which includes major tech companies like Qualcomm, is investing $200 million to install new fiber-optic cable for the Links, each of which can support hundreds of Wi-Fi users simultaneously.\nTHE BRIDGE NEWSLETTER\nSIGN UP FOR BROOKLYN BUSINESS NEWS\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\nHowever, initial ad revenues have been underwhelming.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOver the first two years of the program, the city collected just shy of $43.4 million in payments, narrowly beating the $42.5 million minimum it was guaranteed,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York Post reported\xc2\xa0this month. Part of the problem has been a slower-than-expected rollout because of infrastructure problems encountered along the way. As a result, the administration plans to let CityBridge defer profit-sharing payments in order to allow the consortium to invest more money in the program and get the buildout completed.\nAs the hardware gets installed, LinkNYC keeps developing new content for the boards, ranging from poetry-month features to \xe2\x80\x9cThis Day in New York\xe2\x80\x9d historical facts. Says Stephanie Raphael, director of communications for the city\xe2\x80\x99s DoITT: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re really excited about it.

New York City, for example, deployed Link NYC kiosks, which offer Wi-Fi services and advertisements to residents. Services such as these aren\'t just boosting Wi-Fi, they are also delivering improved quality of life.Mike Gamaroff, senior vice president of strategy, SITO Mobile, Sheldon Silverman, CEO, Smartbomb Media Group and David Pal, CEO of Ads on Top addressed how smart cities are revolutionizing city living during a panel at the Digital Signage Expo.Pal said the first concern for any smart city application is that, "it needs to answer a question." For example, if a city is trying to discover how residents move throughout the city, it should use sensors. Or if residents are unsure about city services, displays need to provide additional information."The core reason for developing smart city solutions is quality of life," Gamaroff said. He pointed out how more people from rural populations in places like China are moving to the cities than ever before. To accommodate these growing populations, smart cities need to develop solutions to handle traffic and deliver services.Silverman said cities can use sensors to see in real time how residents move throughout the city. Using this information, they can then determine if they need better transportation solutions, such as trains. Or cities could develop schedules for delivery trucks to cut down on traffic.On the customer end, smart cities can also offer key information to residents at critical times of the day. With digital signage, these cities can deliver this information easily and they can also measure the real time effects of the data.Gamaroff pointed out that if a city was opening a new park, it could advertise the opening with digital signage. It could then measure the total number of residents visiting the park to see how effective the digital signage really was.Many consumers and governments, however, are concerned about customer data and privacy, especially with recent fiascos with Facebook\'s privacy policy.\xc2\xa0The panelists said that vendors need to spend a lot of time explaining this issue with governments.Sheldon points out that governments might be concerned about collecting location-based data on residents. However, with this data, "You never need to know the name.

(Jared McCallister/New York Daily News)\nRemembrances abound in the wake of Anthony Bourdain\xe2\x80\x99s shocking suicide last week. But one is a short story about the beloved celebrity and the fame he brought to Hilma\xe2\x80\x99s Windsor Castle, a tiny restaurant on the Dutch side of St. Maarten-St. Martin island in the Caribbean.\nMy tale is so, so Bourdain! In a 2004 food article he wrote for The New York Times, the chef-turned travel journalist gave deserving respectful admiration to the fine cuisine all across \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Maarten-St. Martin, the half-Dutch, half-French island in the West Indies,\xe2\x80\x9d but said the small roadside Hilma\xe2\x80\x99s Windsor Castle eatery was \xe2\x80\x9cmy favorite place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdvertisement\nAnthony Bourdain appears at the Empire State Building in 2011 for a hunger awareness event. (Bryan Smith for New York Daily News)\n\xe2\x80\x9cWindsor Castle\xe2\x80\x9d was in a small trailer parked on a long, narrow strip of land in Dutch St. Maarten with a slew of small businesses as neighbors. The likable proprietor, Hilma Harris, sold johnnycakes (traditional flat-fried or griddled cornmeal creations), patties stuffed with fish, chicken or beef, and other treats and drinks. Her breakfast and lunch clientele were island locals and tourists who came by word of mouth. But over the years, thousands more visitors, sparked by Bourdain\xe2\x80\x99s favorable 2004 review, came to Hilma\xe2\x80\x99s seeking the casual atmosphere, good food and great conversation he experienced with Harris \xe2\x80\x94 and they were not disappointed. Bourdain loved Harris and her eatery and she, and her customers, had praise for \xe2\x80\x9cTony.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnfortunately, added to the scores of excellent online reviews for Hilma\xe2\x80\x99s Windsor Castle is a February posting about the establishment\xe2\x80\x99s destruction in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Category 5 Hurricane Irma.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSadly, Hilma\'s Windsor Castle is gone.

Call. Compress.\nThose are the three easy steps medical professionals say can help save a life if someone experiences sudden cardiac arrest.\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the city\xe2\x80\x99s Health Department have teamed up to teach New Yorkers how to perform Hands Only CPR, a simple technique designed to save someone undergoing cardiac arrest.\nThe Hands Only CPR campaign calls on bystanders to check on the victim for responsiveness and breathing, call 911, and compress the victim\xe2\x80\x99s chest by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest with straight arms and interlocked hands, with two compressions per second at least two inches deep.\nDr. Holly Andersen, a cardiologist at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and creator of the Hands Only CPR campaign, said she started the outreach effort because of the concerns about cardiac arrest victims dying when bystanders were unsure of what to do.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone dies every two minutes in this country due to sudden cardiac arrest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about half of all cardiovascular deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAndersen explained that she started the campaign to increase bystander response.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny CPR is better than no CPR,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced saving a life to three easy steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCardiac arrest is the third leading cause of death in America \xe2\x80\x93 there are more than 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the U.S., nearly 90 percent of them fatal, according to the American Heart Association.\nOn June 6, New York-Presbyterian and the Health Department sponsored a training session at El Cata\xc3\xb1o Public Garden in East Harlem, where community members could learn the Hands Only CPR technique.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something that anyone can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Health Department Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett at the event. She said that many people suffering cardiac arrest do not get the help they need, and that the chances of survival decreases by 10 percent for every minute they are not assisted.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something that anyone can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said HealthDepartment Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy of survival for them is time,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bassett. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole point is to start immediately and wait for help to arrive.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEast Harlem was targeted for the training effort because Health Department statistics show that rates of bystander CPR are only 18 percent in black neighborhoods, compared to nearly 47 percent in white neighborhoods, Health Department officials said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to connect with these communities,\xe2\x80\x9d said City Councilmember Bill Perkins, who received CPR training. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really easy to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBassett said that many people are hesitant to do mouth-to-mouth CPR, or are afraid to intervene because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to harm the victim more.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the place of regular CPR, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something anyone can do if they\xe2\x80\x99re not certified for that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to perform mouth-to-mouth to help someone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst thing you can do is nothing. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt someone who\xe2\x80\x99s going to die without your help,\xe2\x80\x9d added Andersen, who said that brain cells begin to die after five minutes if a cardiac arrest victim is not assisted.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a three-step process.\nShe encouraged New Yorkers to download an instructional poster from the Hands On CPR website and post it in their residential buildings or offices.\nAndersen said the Hands on CPR process has been presented to the Police Commissioner, and featured in\xc2\xa0an instructional video playing in the offices of large corporations as well as in yellow cabs. The city will also promote the three-step protocol in a citywide ad campaign on LinkNYC Wi-Fi, bus shelters, Times Square media and a program in New York City health clubs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re starting off doing this in New York City, but we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to take this worldwide,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\xc2\xa0is a\xc2\xa0global issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the East Harlem event, New York-Presbyterian volunteers showed attendees how to perform the Hands On CPR method, and provided them with cards indicating they had received training.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to learn,\xe2\x80\x9d said local resident Raymond Bonhomme. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could save a life.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinda Ortiz and Steven Rodr\xc3\xadguez, who work at the Health Department\xe2\x80\x99s Neighborhood Action Center on East 115th Street, said they hoped to spread the word further in the community.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was really simple to learn, about five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ortiz. \xe2\x80\x9cI plan on telling a lot of others about this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor more information, go to www.handsonly.nyc.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny CPR is better than no CPR,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Holly Andersen, creator of the Hands Only CPR campaign.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something that anyone can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Health Department Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a three-step process.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could save a life,\xe2\x80\x9d said local resident Raymond Bonhomme.\nThe demo was held with community residents.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was really simply to learn, about five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Linda Ortiz (right) with colleague Steven Rodr\xc3\xadguez.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to connect with these communities,\xe2\x80\x9d said City Councilmember Bill Perkins.\nPerkins was trained in the procedure.\nNo m\xc3\xa1s espectadores\nCampa\xc3\xb1a pr\xc3\xa1ctica de reanimaci\xc3\xb3n cardiopulmonar busca salvar vidas\nHistoria y fotos por Gregg McQueen\nLa demostraci\xc3\xb3n se llev\xc3\xb3 a cabo con residentesde la comunidad.\nVerificar.

Holly Andersen, cardi\xc3\xb3loga del New York Presbyterian/Centro M\xc3\xa9dico Weill Cornell de Nueva York y creadora de la campa\xc3\xb1a Hands Only CPR, dijo que comenz\xc3\xb3 el esfuerzo de alcance debido a las preocupaciones de que las v\xc3\xadctimas de paro card\xc3\xadaco murieran mientras los espectadores no sab\xc3\xadan qu\xc3\xa9 hacer.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlguien muere cada dos minutos en este pa\xc3\xads debido a un paro card\xc3\xadaco repentino\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo. \xe2\x80\x9cEs aproximadamente la mitad de todas las muertes cardiovasculares\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAndersen explic\xc3\xb3 que ella comenz\xc3\xb3 la campa\xc3\xb1a para aumentar la respuesta de los espectadores.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCualquier RCP es mejor que ninguna\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo. \xe2\x80\x9cHemos reducido el salvar una vida a tres sencillos pasos\xe2\x80\x9d.\nEl paro card\xc3\xadaco es la tercera causa de muerte en los Estados Unidos: hay m\xc3\xa1s de 356,000 paros card\xc3\xadacos extra hospitalarios anualmente en el pa\xc3\xads, casi el 90 por ciento de ellos son mortales, de acuerdo con la Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Estadounidense del Coraz\xc3\xb3n.\nEl 6 de junio, el New York-Presbyterian y el Departamento de Salud patrocinaron una sesi\xc3\xb3n de capacitaci\xc3\xb3n en el Jard\xc3\xadn P\xc3\xbablico El Cata\xc3\xb1o, en East Harlem, donde los miembros de la comunidad pudieron aprender la t\xc3\xa9cnica de RCP solo con manos.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsto fue muy simple de aprender, de unos cinco minutos,\xe2\x80\x9d dijo Linda Ortiz (a la derecha)con su colega Steven Rodr\xc3\xadguez.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsto es algo que cualquiera puede hacer\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo la comisionada del Departamento de Salud, la Dra. Mary Bassett, en el evento. Explic\xc3\xb3 que muchas personas que sufren un paro card\xc3\xadaco no reciben la ayuda que necesitan, y las posibilidades de supervivencia disminuyen en un 10 por ciento por cada minuto que no reciben ayuda.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEl enemigo de la supervivencia para ellos es el tiempo\xe2\x80\x9d, coment\xc3\xb3 Bassett. \xe2\x80\x9cEl objetivo es comenzar de inmediato y esperar a que llegue la ayuda\xe2\x80\x9d.\nEast Harlem fue el objetivo del esfuerzo de capacitaci\xc3\xb3n porque las estad\xc3\xadsticas del Departamento de Salud muestran que las tasas de RCP de los espectadores son solo del 18 por ciento en los barrios negros, en comparaci\xc3\xb3n con casi el 47 por ciento en los barrios blancos, dijeron funcionarios del Departamento de Salud.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEs importante conectar con estas comunidades\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo el concejal Bill Perkins, quien recibi\xc3\xb3 capacitaci\xc3\xb3n en RCP. \xe2\x80\x9cEs realmente f\xc3\xa1cil de hacer\xe2\x80\x9d.\nBassett dijo que muchas personas dudan en hacer RCP boca a boca, o tienen miedo de intervenir porque no quieren da\xc3\xb1ar m\xc3\xa1s a la v\xc3\xadctima.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEs importante conectar con estas comunidades\xe2\x80\x9d,dijo Bill Perkins, concejal de la ciudad.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsto no sustituye la RCP regular, pero es algo que cualquier persona puede hacer si no est\xc3\xa1 certificada para ello\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo. \xe2\x80\x9cNo es necesario que practicar el boca a boca para ayudar a alguien\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo peor que puedes hacer es nada. No se puede lastimar a alguien que va a morir sin ayuda\xe2\x80\x9d, agreg\xc3\xb3 Andersen, explicando que las c\xc3\xa9lulas del cerebro comienzan a morir despu\xc3\xa9s de cinco minutos si no se ayuda a una v\xc3\xadctima de un paro card\xc3\xadaco.\nAnim\xc3\xb3 a los neoyorquinos a descargar un p\xc3\xb3ster instructivo del sitio web Hands On CPR y a colocarlo en sus edificios de vivienda u oficinas residenciales.\nAndersen dijo que el proceso Hands on CPR se present\xc3\xb3 al comisionado de Polic\xc3\xada y se incluy\xc3\xb3 en un video instructivo que se reproduce en las oficinas de las grandes corporaciones y en los taxis amarillos. La ciudad tambi\xc3\xa9n promover\xc3\xa1 el protocolo de tres pasos en una campa\xc3\xb1a publicitaria en toda la ciudad en LinkNYC Wi-Fi, refugios de autobuses, medios de Times Square y un programa en los clubes de salud de la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstamos comenzando a hacer esto en la ciudad de Nueva York, pero estamos buscando llevarlo a todo el mundo\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo. \xe2\x80\x9cEste es un problema global\xe2\x80\x9d.\nEn el evento de East Harlem, los voluntarios del New York-Presbyterian mostraron a los asistentes c\xc3\xb3mo realizar el m\xc3\xa9todo RCP solo con manos y les proporcionaron tarjetas indicando que recibieron capacitaci\xc3\xb3n.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEs algo bueno de aprender\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo el residente local Raymond Bonhomme. \xe2\x80\x9cPodr\xc3\xada salvar una vida\xe2\x80\x9d.\nLinda Ortiz y Steven Rodr\xc3\xadguez, quienes trabajan en el Centro de Acci\xc3\xb3n del Vecindario del Departamento de Salud en la calle 115 este, dijeron que esperan correr la voz en la comunidad.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsto fue muy simple de aprender, unos cinco minutos\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo Ortiz. \xe2\x80\x9cPlaneo contarles a muchos otros sobre esto\xe2\x80\x9d.\nPara obtener m\xc3\xa1s informaci\xc3\xb3n, vaya a\xc2\xa0www.handsonly.nyc.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCualquier RCP es mejor que ninguna\xe2\x80\x9d, dijo la Dra.

While researching the application process, CfA found that a large number of applicants were over the income limit to qualify \xe2\x80\x94 be it because they were overlooking source of income or because the application worded its question in a way that resulted in guestimating.\nOperating with the belief that individuals unlikely to be eligible due to income should find out as quickly as possible, CfA turned to user-centric research to help it make changes to GetCalFresh, noting that getting rejected more quickly in the process would give individuals a chance to find alternative food assistance in a more timely manner.\nRELATEDWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: Bloomberg Announces $42 Million Addition to What Works Cities InitiativeWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: New Legislation in Connecticut Bolsters State\xe2\x80\x99s Open Data EffortsWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: More than 50 Services Now Available on my.indy.govTo improve in this regard, CfA is now working to improve GetCalFresh\xe2\x80\x99s application so that it provides better guidance about reporting income, specifically unearned income such as disability, veteran benefits, money received from a friend or relative, and worker\xe2\x80\x99s compensation.\nUser-centered research and design is a process in which developers extensively study the people who use services, rather than just scientifically guessing at their needs. Relatively common in the private sector in recent years, the discipline is currently being deployed by an increasing number of governmental organizations and vendors across the country.\nLinkNYC kiosks celebrate city\xe2\x80\x99s famous Caribbean residents\nTo celebrate June as Caribbean Heritage Month, LinkNYC kiosks in New York City are sporting images of influential Americans of Caribbean heritage.\nThis program first launched last year, and it is a collaboration between New York\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and CARIBBEING, a cultural organization based in Brooklyn. The Caribbean American icons will be featured on the 55-inch digital display kiosks spread throughout the city with a goal of raising awareness about their contributions.\nWhile last year the program included figures such as artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, rapper the Notorious B.I.G., and Queen of Salsa Celia Cruz, this year\xe2\x80\x99s program will expand to feature even more visages. New this year are comedian Majah Hype, singer and musician Amara La Negra, and author Elizabeth Acevedo.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis month, New Yorkers will get to see some of the most influential Caribbean American icons of the past century just by walking by a LinkNYC kiosk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samir Saini, New York\xe2\x80\x99s IT commissioner in a press release. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled to collaborate with Caribbeing to showcase the Caribbean culture and heritage while shining a light on the figures who have positively impacted New York City.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC is made up of more than 1,650 individual kiosks spread throughout the city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs. It was first launched in early 2016.\nNashville launches new app to improve government interactions with citizens\nNashville is launching a new app to accompany the hubNashville online portal the city debuted late last year, according to local news reports.\nThe new app is designed to give citizens easier access, 24 hours a day, to municipal government services. This comes in the form of everything from reporting problems about street lights to getting information about job opportunities at city hall. After a problem is reported, the app will send users updates about how that problem is being handled.\nIn addition to the app, the city has also created an online video tutorial for residents. Essentially, the app is a comprehensive mobile customer service center aimed at connecting residents for any non-emergency services, handling requests made of the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office, the Metro Council Office, public works, codes and metro water services\xe2\x80\x99 stormwater division.\nAccording to the app\xe2\x80\x99s website, more departments and agencies will be added soon.\nHumboldt County, Calif., enhances website accessibility\nHumboldt County, Calif., has launched an enhanced website aimed at increasing equitable access to its services for users with disabilities, both with and without access to assistive technology devices.\nAs government services move increasingly online, there is a fear among many officials, advocates and residents that digital equity will leave some residents behind. Perhaps most frequently, this fear is framed in terms of income levels, but it also applies to the inclusion of users who suffer disabilities.\nEssentially, digitizing as many services as possible is wonderful. Agencies, however, must also work to make sure those digitized services are available to individuals with visual, hearing or other disabilities.\nThis is the situation that Humboldt County \xe2\x80\x94 home to more than 135,000 residents in Northern California, near the border with Oregon \xe2\x80\x94 has sought to remedy.\nTo make these enhancements, the county worked with Civic Plus\xe2\x80\x99 CivicEngage Website design and hosting solution, as well as with AudioEye Inc., which is CivicPlus\xe2\x80\x99 accessibility solution provider.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIT has several goals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim Storm, Humboldt County\xe2\x80\x99s IT division director, in a press release. \xe2\x80\x9cStrive to keep current with technology, ensure reliable systems and provide excellent customer service. With CivicPlus, our website is optimized for efficiency, and we have a collocated geographically diverse data center and 24/7/365 support. We also wanted to be a leader among California counties in Web accessibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAudioEye is software that monitors websites as they grow or are modified in order to automatically fix certain issues to ensure accessibility for users of assistive technology for disabilities.\nZack Quaintance\nAssistant News Editor\nZack Quaintance is the assistant news editor for Government Technology.

Images will be displayed from the Museum\xe2\x80\x99s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs.\nPasserby on the street will be able to catch a glimpse of the old New York through the lens of the iconic film director. Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s photographs highlight his formative years as a photographer (before he became a film director) for Look magazine in New York City between 1945-1950. The photographs focus on and capture the pathos of everyday life of the city, from street scenes to sporting events.\nThe LinkNYC kiosks can be found dotted all over the city. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the program in 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs and have replaced the old pay phones with sleek kiosks that feature free Wi-Fi, phone chargers, and digital displays for advertisements and in this case, art.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that LinkNYC has featured art on its kiosks from MCNY. Previous \xe2\x80\x9cexhibitions\xe2\x80\x9d on the kiosks include historic photos of women who influenced New York\xe2\x80\x99s political history for Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month and \xe2\x80\x9cOn This Day in NYC History\xe2\x80\x9d information. The MCNY and LinkNYC partnership is one of many programs that disseminate New York City\xe2\x80\x99s history; others include the NYC Space/Time Directory from the New York Public Library, an app from Urban Archive that made more than 2,500 images of old New York available on-the-go, and a Civil Rights & Social Justice Map from the Greenwich Village Society.\nLinkNYC\nMCNY\nPublic Art\nRelated Stories\nJune 21, 2019\nOur (Enclosed) Town\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nJune 6, 2019\nDisaster Dioramas\nArtist Josh Kline brings climate change home in a new Manhattan show\nJune 3, 2019\nCarpet Diem\nMiniature undulating cityscape comes to Madison Square Park\nMay 21, 2019\nSO-IL Meets Soil\nSO-IL and West 8 team up for an Artpark outside Buffalo, New York\nTrending\nMost Popular\nMost Recent\nNational Trust for Historic Preservation names 2019\xe2\x80\x99s most endangered places\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nJunya Ishigami reveals completed Serpentine Pavilion\nDetroit picks team to shape Midtown cultural center\nIs Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Hare Express System dead?\nConstruction begins on massive Machu Picchu airport despite protests\nTWA Hotel opens in JFK Airport\xe2\x80\x99s Eero Saarinen\xe2\x80\x93designed landmark\nFrench Senate declares Notre Dame must be rebuilt as it was before, quashing competition\nFrank Lloyd Wright cabin outside of Chicago faces demolition\nDetroit picks team to shape Midtown cultural center\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nSeattle makes affordable housing mandatory in upzoned neighborhoods\nHarvard\xe2\x80\x99s HouseZero is a live-in lab for sustainable renovation\nThomas Kelley reviews Virgil Abloh\xe2\x80\x99s mid-career retrospective\nCopyright 2019The Architect's Newspaper, LLCAll rights reserved.\nRegions\nInternational\nEast\nSoutheast\nMidwest\nWest\nSouthwest\nTopics\nAN Interior\nArchitecture\nArt\nDesign\nDevelopment\nPreservation\nTransportation\nUrbanism\nNewsletters\nFacades+\nSpec Sheet\nCity Terrain\nLate Edition: East\nLate Edition: West\nLate Edition: Midwest\nLate Edition: Southwest\nConferences\nFacades+ Conference\nFacades+ AM\nTech+\nInformation\nAwards\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nMap\nThe Architect's Newspaper, LLC | 21 Murray Street, 5th Floor | New York, NY 10007 | tel. 212.966.0630\nCopyright 2019, All rights reserved.", b"BT Begin Deploying 12 Ultrafast WiFi InLinkUK Kiosks in Glasgow - ISPreview UK\nMobile Menu\nHome\nISP List and Comparison\nSpeedtest\nReader Reviews\nTop 10 UK ISPs\nDiscussion Forum\nBroadband Technology\nComplaints Advice\nEditorial Articles\nContact Us\nHome\nArticles\nISP List\nReviews\nTop 10\nForum\nSpeedtest\nBroadband\nComplaints\nContact\nHome\xc2\xa0\xc2\xbb\xc2\xa0ISP News\xc2\xa0\xc2\xbb\nSponsored\nBT Begin Deploying 12 Ultrafast WiFi InLinkUK Kiosks in Glasgow\nTuesday, June 19th, 2018 (12:00 pm) - Score 2,249\nEmail | Link News\n9 Comments\nAfter deploying in London and Leeds, BT has today announced the first roll-out of 12 InLinkUK smart kiosks in Glasgow (Scotland), which claim to offer \xe2\x80\x9cultrafast\xe2\x80\x9d 1Gbps capable free public WiFi, free UK phone calls, USB device charging and a range of other digital services to help people in the vicinity.\nThe first kiosk went live on Buchanan Street and others will soon follow around the city centre. Overall a total of 150 kiosks have now been rolled out to parts of London, Leeds and Glasgow. The InLinkUK kiosks reflect a partnership between BT, Intersection (LinkNYC) and advertising company Primesight. The plan is that they will eventually replace over 1,000 pay phones in major cities across the UK. Funding for the kiosks is extracted via revenues from advertising on the large 55\xe2\x80\xb3 HD digital displays.\nNeil Scoresby, BT\xe2\x80\x99s GM for Payphones and InLinkUK, said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s launch in Glasgow brings the fastest free public wi-fi in the UK to Scotland. Residents and visitors alike are set to benefit from this new state-of-the-art \xe2\x80\x98phone box\xe2\x80\x99, where they can also make calls for free, access local information and even charge their \xe2\x80\x98phone when out and about.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnfortunately BT has not provided any evidence to substantiate their claim of offering the \xe2\x80\x9cfastest free public wi-fi in the UK\xe2\x80\x9d (difficult to prove). Some speed testing conducted last year (here) unsurprisingly revealed that real-world performance actually came in well below the headline claims of \xe2\x80\x98up to\xe2\x80\x99 1Gbps (sub-100Mbps is a more viable expectation).\nWireless broadband signals and network congestion are of course notoriously difficult things to tackle in a real-world environment but this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t overshadow the fact that BT\xe2\x80\x99s kiosks still offer a useful set of features. The real speeds may struggle to hit a Gigabit but they\xe2\x80\x99re still impressively fast for a free public WiFi hotspot.\nSince the first InLink was installed in June last year, more than 100,000 people have subscribed to the service\xe2\x80\x99s free wi-fi, using \xe2\x80\x9cenough data to download the equivalent of over 12 million songs.\xe2\x80\x9d The InLinks have also \xe2\x80\x9csaved users more than \xc2\xa3352,000 in free calls, with 33,000 calls being made on average every week.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUPDATE 1:09pm\nWe understand that planning consent for more kiosks has already been approved by local councils in Birmingham, Newcastle, Southampton, Gateshead and Sheffield, as well as the London borough of Kensington & Chelsea.\nTweet\nTags: BT , Scotland , Wireless Internet\nBy Mark Jackson\nMark is a professional technology writer, IT consultant and computer engineer from Dorset (England), he also founded ISPreview in 1999 and enjoys analysing the latest telecoms and broadband developments.

A new campaign called Summer in the City to launch June 21st will feature images from the Museum\'s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs, which highlights the iconic film director\'s formative years in New York City as a photographer for Look magazine between 1945-1950.\n"We\'re proud to partner with MCNY to serve both residents and visitors by extending the Museum\'s rich archive of photography to the streets of New York," said Samir Saini, Commissioner for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. "New Yorkers in all five boroughs will catch a glimpse of history, art and culture just by passing by a LinkNYC kiosk. What better way to start the summer!"\n"In addition to providing super-fast, free Wi-Fi to four million New Yorkers and visitors, LinkNYC is fundamentally changing the way information is delivered on the go. Through the content on our digital displays, we have brought useful and enriching information to the streets of New York, including in partnership with great local organizations that have made Link a beloved member of the community," said Jen Hensley, President of Link. "We are so thrilled to partner with the Museum of the City of New York, a great New York City institution, to bring their incredible content to our five-borough network."\n"Partnering with LinkNYC and DoITT is the perfect opportunity to both extend our content beyond the walls of the Museum as well as reinforce the Museum\'s mission as an institution that captures the inclusive urban experience by spotlighting relevant contemporary issues important to New Yorkers," said Whitney Donhauser, Ronay Menschel Director of the Museum of the City of New York. "The Summer in the City campaign, featuring the photography of Stanley Kubrick encompasses the rich, diverse history of the city while giving you a glimpse into the iconic director\'s future work as an artist who continues to be celebrated globally."\nLinkNYC has partnered with the Museum on multiple campaigns, ranging from highlighting historic photos of women who influenced New York political history for Women\'s History Month from the Museum\'s exhibition, Beyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics, to surfacing new \'On This Day In NYC History\' (#OTDNYC) information every day. The programs aim to increase access to city history and delight New Yorkers and visitors while on the go.\nThrough a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs is made possible in part by Ann G. Tenenbaum and Thomas H. Lee, Nancy and Mitchell Steir, The Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation, The Andrew and Marina Lewin Foundation, Daryl Brown Uber/William E. Weiss Foundation, and George A. Kellner.\nThis exhibition is organized by the Museum of the City of New York in collaboration with SK Film Archives LLC.\nDigitization of the Stanley Kubrick Photographs from the Look magazine collection was made possible in part by the Charina Endowment Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Daryl Brown Uber/William E. Weiss Foundation, and other generous donors.\nDoITT is the technology core of New York City government, working with over 100 city agencies and entities to deliver the tech they need to serve and empower New Yorkers. DoITT\'s technology solutions help keep the five boroughs safe, strong, and vibrant. For more information, visit nyc.gov/DoITT or visit us on Facebook or Twitter.\nLinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next few years.\nMore than 4 million people - more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas, or San Diego - have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of new users joining the network each week.\nIn addition to free Wi-Fi, each Link offers free phone calls, device charging, and a tablet to access maps, 311, the social services platform Aunt Bertha, and access to 911. All of Link\'s services are 100% free for users and come at no cost to taxpayers.\nFor more information and to find a Link near you, visit link.nyc.\nFounded in 1923 as a private, nonprofit corporation, the Museum of the City of New York celebrates and interprets the city, educating the public about its distinctive character, especially its heritage of diversity, opportunity, and perpetual transformation.

He had previously built himself a trip planner for London Underground (a good four years prior to London launching its own planner), and at UCSF, he built his own tools to determine the most efficient transit options home after late nights of studying. This passion for tech-driven mobility solutions led Caywood to Washington, DC, where his infatuation with transportation transformed into a business.\nIn 2013, Caywood and co-founder Ryan Croft launched TransitScreen, a company that curates local, real-time mobility information \xe2\x80\x94 including bus and rail times, wait times for ride-sharing apps and the proximity of bike- and scooter-share systems \xe2\x80\x94 and displays it on screens in commercial buildings. The screens are located across more than 40 cities in the U.S. and Canada, with some even sprinkled throughout the U.K., Ireland and France.\nThe growth of TransitScreen followed a true startup trajectory, having started in Caywood\'s garage before moving to the former 1776 incubator, and eventually into its own office. Caywood describes the company as "scrappy" and touts its most strategic business decision \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0to sell to real estate clients.\nThe TransitScreen office in Washington, DC.\nKristin Musulin\n"The cities are advocates for us because we\xe2\x80\x99re helping them by providing public information that anyone, no matter who they are \xe2\x80\x94 young or old, rich or poor \xe2\x80\x94 can get,"\xc2\xa0Caywood said. "But what we do instead is work with the real estate industry and with employers to put that information into as many public and public-ish locations as possible."\nTransitScreen displays are most commonly found in commercial offices, apartment buildings, hotels, restaurants and university buildings.\n"It\'s a very different model from, say, a LinkNYC model where they have to spend hundreds of millions in capital costs to roll out their network then find a way to recoup that," Caywood explained. "We\'re able to make a very large impact on smart cities while still being a very small and lightly-funded company."\nReal-time data on the big screen\nBy offering transportation information on a public display, the TransitScreen team is aiming to preserve a valued asset of the everyday public transit user: time.\nA recent report from McKinsey Global Institute\xc2\xa0found that, by 2025, the cities that deploy smart mobility applications could reduce average commuting times by 15-20%. "When a resident looks at real-time traffic data and decides to set out at a less busy time, she avoids adding another car to the road that would worsen congestion for everyone," the report says.\xc2\xa0"Millions of individual decisions and actions add up, making the city as a whole more productive and responsive."\nTransitScreen\nCaywood said by giving city residents the option to view this real-time data right before walking out of the door, it alleviates the responsibility of looking up the information on your mobile device. And, while TransitScreen has optimized its service to be responsive to a mobile screen, Caywood said only one in every 10 public transit riders ever checks their phone for such information.\n"Most of the trips that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make are starting at a particular location \xe2\x80\x94 your home or your work. Being able to provide the information at a glance in an efficient and easy-to-use manner, that\xe2\x80\x99s when you have the biggest impact," he said.\nOf course the company faces a lot of pressure to keep its information accurate and up-to-date as new mobility solutions enter the market. Caywood said this is a "core goal of our product," and is accomplished through active partnerships.\n"Our approach is we want to work with all of the different mobility providers to inform our audience ... about the options that are available and the choices that they can now make," he said. "So our approach to that has been to partner with them, and we\'re now seeing that as we\'ve established our presence in the space, people are kind of now coming to us with data and saying, \'What does it take to get on TransitScreen\'s platform?\'"\nEven with the influx of new electric scooter and dockless bike companies coming online, Caywood said TransitScreen is in "active conversations" with everyone in the space.\nRanking a location with MobilityScore\nIn addition to the traditional TransitScreen platform, the company has also developed MobilityScore, a tool that ranks city locations based on access to mobility services. Similar to tools like Walk Score, MobilityScore measures how easy it is to move around a city by scoring any location or address from 0 (no mobility options) to 100 (excellent mobility options).\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s based on actual data and not just schedules, so it\xe2\x80\x99s the only tool of its kind,"\xc2\xa0Caywood said. And while the tool is only in its beta phase, it has already been rolled out in most of the top 100 largest cities in North America. The company has also worked with real estates sites like Rent Jungle to optimize property and rental searches.\nCaywood called MobilityScore an "intrinsically international product" and said TransitScreen will continue to roll out the tool in new places.\xc2\xa0In a blog post,\xc2\xa0the company also called the tool "future-proof" and said it will be continuously updated with information on microtransit, autonomous vehicles and mobility-as-a-service.\nThe MobilityScore results for a location in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, DC.\nTransitScreen\nLooking forward\nFrom its active social media accounts to regular e-mail newsletters, TransitScreen is vocal about its desire to grow alongside the cities where it operates. Caywood hinted the company has a few new offerings in the works, and is continually looking for ways to "make the TransitScreen experience more relevant to the people who are viewing it and using it."\nAnd aside from internal strategies,\xc2\xa0Caywood believes the evolution of smart cities will help the company stay along a successful growth path. He said his understanding of a "smart city" is one that takes data and translates it into useful information \xe2\x80\x94 which is at the core of TransitScreen\'s business.\n"We started with this unique public information solution but we\xe2\x80\x99re really taking it to wherever people are making decisions based on mobility," he said. "There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole different side of smart cities that people don\'t even think about because we\xe2\x80\x99re so caught up in stage one, which is data collection. Stage two is where, say Waze starts changing traffic patterns and you have to start thinking what to do with it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the interesting part and that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of where the future of smart cities is going. So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re pointed to.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFollow\nKristin Musulin\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTransportation\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nTransitScreen\nGet smart cities news like this in your inbox daily.

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls, or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Q. What are the main features the kiosks offer?A. LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Q. How do they improve the lives of residents?A. LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Q. How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?A. Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Q. What type of ads do the kiosks display?A. LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Q. Do the kiosks use any analytics?A. We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Q. Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?A.\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model. In addition to New York, a Link network is live in the U.K.\xc2\xa0We have planned expansions into Philadelphia and Newark, with many more cities on the way.Image via Link.Topics: Advertising, Audience Measurement, Content, Customer Experience, Display Technology, DOOH Advertising, Outdoor Signage Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

Been curious?\nWonder no more! The kiosk is an interactive panel installed by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) under its Smart City project.\nEmulating New York\'s \'LinkNYC\', they have been designed to provide people wholesome information about the capital like government department sites, railways, airlines, maps, bus services and more.\nKnow about LinkNYC, NDMC\'s inspiration for the project\nLinkNYC kiosks were started in 2015, replacing the city\'s network of 9,000-13,000 payphones. As of July 2017, there are 920 Links citywide. Eventually, there will be 7,500 Links installed in the New York metropolitan area, making the system the world\'s fastest and most expansive.\nDetails\nPanels set up in CP\'s Palika Bazar and Charkha Museum\nCredits:\nThe 9ft high, 46-inch wide panel is not just an information-provider, it also includes a mobile charging point, sensor and camera along with free WiFi.\nFor earning revenue through the panel, NDMC has kept a 75-inch LED screen for advertisements.\nAs of now, two panels have been set up in Connaught Place, one at Palika Bazar and another near Charkha Museum.\nLove Delhi news?\nStay updated with the latest happenings.\nYes, notify Me\nNDMC speaks\n50 such panels being installed throughout Delhi, may be increased\nNDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said they have procured 50 such panels to be set up in Sansad Marg, Lodhi Colony, Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar, Mandi House, Bengali Market, India Gate and Gole Market.\n"In the second phase, if the project is successful and well received by the public, we might increase the number of panels from 50 to 75," added Kumar.\n\'Transaction facility will not be available as of now\'\n"We have selected locations with high footfall and market places where these panels will be installed. The transaction facility will not be available as of now due to security issues. We are exploring possibilities for improving the services provided by these panels," he said.\nShare this timeline\nDelhi\nMunicipal Corporation Of Delhi\nTourism\n9ft\nBengali Market\nCharkha Museum\nConnaught Place\nCP\nEmulating New York\nGole Market\nIndia Gate\nKhan Market\nLED\nLinkNYC\nLodhi Colony\nMandi House\nNaresh Kumar\nNDMC\nNew Delhi Municipal Council\nNew York\nPalika Bazar\nSansad Marg\nSarojini Nagar\nSmart City\nWiFi\nShare this timeline\nAskCancel\nRelated Timelines\nDelhi\nNo relief from cold as Delhi records minimum of 3.7C\nDelhi\nDelhi shivers at 3.6 degree Celsius, lowest temperature this season\nDelhi\nDelhi\'s minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius again\nNext Timeline\nLink copied to clipboard', b'How strategic public-private partnerships are shaping up in cities | GreenBiz\nHome\nMain menuInsights\nEvents\nVideos\nSecondary menuCircular Economy\nEnergy\nTransportation\nSustainability\nSupply Chain\nCities\nBuildings\nWater\nGreenbiz on Social Media\nTwitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nLinkedIn\nThis site (RSS)\nSearch\nSearch\nToggle navigation\nHow strategic public-private partnerships are shaping up in citiesSue LebeckTuesday, June 26, 2018 - 1:30am\nShutterstocknaKornCreate\nThis is second in a series on the role of public-private partnerships in realizing smart, sustainable cities, systems and industries.Public-private partnerships (PPPs) fall into four key types: operating partnerships; advisory committees; project partnerships; and strategic partnerships. Of these, the most potent and long-ranging partnerships are strategic. Although they may begin with a single project, they ultimately provide a platform capable of generating new projects with the potential to achieve far-reaching impacts over time.This article describes the high-level shaping of strategic partnerships in cities \xe2\x80\x94 reviewing the organizing approaches of several successful strategic platforms, and pointing to the first key partners to turn to.Organizing models for strategic partnershipStrategic approaches to PPP development typically require the creation of a partnership organization. The platform that results effectively can become a PPP-generating machine.Envision Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s public-private-plus collaborative formed a nonprofit organization to anchor its efforts. "We created a neutral platform to allow us to structure a win-win for everyone," executive director Amy Aussieker explained. It also offers protection. Since its founding in 2010, Charlotte has had six mayors, although this organization has persisted across mayors and even private-sector CEOs. "Though this was not the reason for forming a nonprofit, in hindsight it was a benefit," she said.\nUtilities are natural partners to cities.\nThe first-of-its-kind PPP platform for Smart City development, Envision Charlotte has become a model for others. Its first partners included local utility Duke Energy, technology company Cisco Systems and Charlotte Center City, a nonprofit that promotes the development of Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s urban core. In its mission to improve sustainability around energy, air, water and waste, it gathered additional partners, including local banks and other businesses, technology and services company Itron, engineering firm CH2M Hill, network provider Verizon, waste-management specialist Enevo and the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. Most recently, it created a citizen-focused ECO Network to extend its sustainability goals deeper into the community.Indeed, citizen engagement is a secret sauce to help smart city evolution perform for all stakeholders.An organizing approach developed by Envision Utah has been replicated by dozens of regions around the United States. Envision Utah is a nonprofit public-private partnership that engages community stakeholders from a statewide umbrella, whose goal is "empowering people to create the communities they want." It acts as a neutral facilitator, bringing together residents, elected officials, developers, conservationists, business leaders and other interested parties to make informed decisions about how Utah should grow.This has resulted in a Quality Growth Strategy and a growth-planning toolkit designed for use by civic leaders, businesses and the public at large. These tools can be used to inform an implementation pathway for a range of multi-player partnerships.More recently, the KCMO Smart City initiative in Kansas City, Missouri, is testing a novel model for organizing a PPP: to procure a private-sector partner to join them and lead the effort. After building out an initial smart-city platform along a free downtown streetcar line (via initial PPP activity involving Cisco, Sprint and Think Big Partners), it is fielding a Request for Proposals (RFP) to recruit a lead PPP partner to expand its Smart City program.The prime partner is visualized as either a nonprofit consortium or a for-profit firm, which has demonstrated that it can build an extensive suite of capabilities and manage a partnership of public and private players, including community partners and stakeholders. This PPP-leading organization\xe2\x80\x99s scope will include the creation of new business models that can sustain the smart-city projects and sustain the PPP.Kansas City Chief Innovation Officer Bob Bennett explained: "KCMO has assets in play that we are bringing to the table: fiber and pre-coordinated access to assets. We will collaboratively build out the array of initiatives so that the city improves the lives of its people and our partner succeeds."A city\'s first partners: utilitiesSmart, sustainable cities depend on reliable and resilient energy systems. Jesse Berst, chairman of the Smart Cities Council, urges cities interested in starting a smart cities program to partner first with their local electric utility company. To that end, the council and the Edison Electric Institute formed a joint initiative, Electric Companies Advancing Cities; its task force is holding three city-utility summits in 2018, culminating with a playbook to capture best practices and case studies.\nCitizen engagement is a secret sauce to help smart city evolution perform for all stakeholders.\nAussieker of Envision Charlotte agrees that utilities are natural partners to cities. "Most cities have a public utility, which owns assets outside the city. So, if the city doesn\xe2\x80\x99t engage with that utility, how can you get to a sustainable [model]?" To illuminate the point: "Duke Energy [in Charlotte] owns the light poles while the city owns the right of way and leases the poles." In addition, "You need to partner with your utility to act on a goal of 100 percent renewable energy." Do you need to form a PPP for that? "No, but if you do you will be a lot more successful."Envision Utah is following precisely that path. Salt Lake City is in a region whose climate is warming more than twice as fast as the national average, negatively affecting water reserves and air quality. Led by the findings of Envision\xe2\x80\x99s Utah\xe2\x80\x99s citizen survey, the region is responding with urgency, and is partnering with its local utility Rocky Mountain Power. Envision has drafted a plan to acquire all the community\'s electricity from renewable sources by 2032, reducing emissions, saving water and improving air quality in the process.Communications network providers represent another potential utility partner with a natural role to play within smart cities. Partnership examples include communications projects such as New York City\xe2\x80\x99s street-facing LinkNYC, built in partnership with the CityBridge consortium (there\xe2\x80\x99s Google inside); and Huntsville, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s unique network build-out partnership with Google Fiber. In contrast, Chattanooga\xe2\x80\x99s game-changing municipal Internet the Gig was built alone when incumbent private partners were not ready to step up their play.The lesson for utility providers: Don\xe2\x80\x99t play with the public sector at your own risk.The next article in this series will expand on the diverse roles to be played in a potent public-private partnership.Topics:\xc2\xa0Cities\nTags:\xc2\xa0partnerships\npublic-private partnerships\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nshare this article\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nSue Lebeck\nApplication Manager\nCool City Challenge\nView the discussion thread.\nRelated Content\nToward a playbook for public-private partnershipsBySue Lebeck\nFrom Cape Town to Charlotte, there\'s a partner for every purposeBySue Lebeck\nGetting your business ready for smart city partnership BySue Lebeck\nHere\'s the resiliency recipe for cities of the futureByMike Hower\nThe power of collaboration for the digital innovations of Smart CitiesByBas Boorsma\nTrending\nEpisode 177: Sounding off at Circularity 19ByHeather Clancy\nThe circular designer\xe2\x80\x99s secret weapon: policyByJoe Iles\nShake it up: A Q&A with Sarah Pool, co-founder of upcycled spent grain protein shake companyByAlexander Lykins\nHow the Target Center\'s \'nutritional curator\' wins with clean foodByLew Blaustein\nEnergy emissions rise at fastest rate in seven yearsByMadeleine Cuff\nFeatured Videos\nWhy utilities and cities are joining REBA\nMore from Video\nFeatured Whitepapers\nThe Sustainable Edge\xe2\x84\xa2\nUnderstanding the Effective Use of Green Product Labels\nGet your copy\nSummer\xc2\xa0Rates\xc2\xa0Now Available\nSubscribe to our Newsletters\nFooter menu 1About Us\nGreenBiz Team\nEditorial Team\nMedia Kit\nContact Us\nFooter menu 2Executive Network\nResearch Reports\nWhite Papers\nWebcasts\nFooter menu 3Newsletters\nGreenBiz 350 Podcast\nGreenBiz Careers\nJobs\nTwitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nLinkedIn\nThis site (RSS)\nSecondary Footer menuPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 GreenBiz Group Inc.

The 9ft-panel will have features including 46-inch interactive panel to give access to all government department sites, railways, airlines, wayfinder, maps, bus services, NDMC services, tourist spots, air quality data etc, free WiFi, mobile charging point, sensor and camera to monitor. It also has a 75-inch LED screen for advertisement panel. NDMC has installed one at Palika Bazar entrance and one near Charkha Museum in Connaught Place. NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar told TOI that the council has procured 50 such panels, which will be installed across NDMC areas including Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar, Mandi House, Bengali Market, India Gate, Gole Market, Sansad Marg, Lodhi Colony etc. \xe2\x80\x9cNew York City has implemented this concept and we have taken a cue from them to provide free WiFi services along with an interactive panel to avail government services. We have selected locations with high footfall and market places where these panels will be installed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kumar. \xe2\x80\x9cLink NYC panels have two 55-inch screens, one for advertisement and one interactive panel, which we have modified as 75-inch advertisement panel and 46-inch interactive panel. In the second phase, if the project is successful and well received by the public, we might increase the number of panels from 50 to 75,\xe2\x80\x9d added Kumar. \xe2\x80\x9cThe transaction facility will not be available as of now due to security issues.

Initiated in 2014 this project aims to connect several cities with free internet connectivity. \'Link Kiosks\' in New York were set up to reduce dependency on payphones and other wired systems.\xc2\xa0 However, free super fast WiFi is also speeding its way to India as the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) has taken up a similar digital project that would link up Delhi with free WiFi availability.\xc2\xa0 NDMC has installed two \'Link Kiosks\' in New Delhi\'s financial and business hub, Connaught Place under its smart city project. One at Palika Bazar entrance and one near Charkha Museum. C.P witnesses a large turnout of customers, traders and businessmen. People have often complained of low internet connectivity at the shopping hub which also forms an integral part of India\'s historical architecture. With the rapid growth of Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC),commuters exiting adjoining stations like Rajiv Chowk, Mandi House, Janpath will also benefit from NDMC\'s \'Link Delhi\' project.\nKey Features\xc2\xa0 The Kiosk will have two screens, while one will cater to the advertising needs, the other will be used for interaction. New York currently has two 55-inch screens which NDMC has modified to a 75 inch advertisement panel and a 46 inch interactive panel, said NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar to TOI.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t Miss\nStarving & Exhausted Polar Bear Wanders Into Industrial Siberian Town, 1,500 Kms Away From Home\n18K SHARES\nOver 100 Children Dead: Bihar Health Minister Talks Cricket While PM Tweets Yoga\n22.3K SHARES\nWorld\'s Largest Slum, Dharavi, Beats Taj Mahal And Emerges As Favourite Place For Travellers...\n2.9K SHARES\n64% Indians Don\xe2\x80\x99t Want Refugees, Is Compassion Missing In The Land Of Buddha?\n4.3K SHARES\nPeople Refused To Help This Mother Get Her Encephalitis Battling Kid To Hospital, Till This...\n3.3K SHARES\nThe interactive panel will provide access to to all government department sites, railways, airlines, wayfinder, maps, bus services, NDMC services, tourist spots, air quality data etc, free WiFi, mobile charging point, sensor and camera to monitor.\nThe Corporation has an objective of installing 50 such kiosks in popular visitors\' spots like Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar, Lodhi Colony, India Gate etc. If the initiative is successful then the number of panels will be increased from 50 to 75 in the next phase.\xc2\xa0 "New York City has implemented this concept and we have taken a cue from them to provide free WiFi services along with an interactive panel to avail government services.

However, the users will not be able to avail transaction facilities for the time being, due to security issues.\xc2\xa0 If NDMC\'s project to link Delhi with free WiFi succeeds then general public shall be able to call for help during emergency through these panels.

You will come across two such screens at Connaught Place- one at Palika Bazar and another near Charkha Museum.With an aim to provide all-round information pertaining to the national capital, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has come up with \xe2\x80\x98NDMC Link\xe2\x80\x99 digital interactive panels which comprises all government department sites and information regarding railways, airlines, wayfinder, maps, bus services, NDMC services, tourist spots and air quality data.Taken from \xe2\x80\x98Link NYC\xe2\x80\x99 concept in New York City, NDMC\xe2\x80\x99s new service is part of its mega-budget smart city project. You will come across two such screens at Connaught Place- one at Palika Bazar and another near Charkha Museum. NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said that the motive behind installing such panels was to provide free WiFi services and accsess to important government services, Times Of India reported.Apart from information and access to key websites, salient features of this panel include a mobile charging point, sensor and camera along with free WiFi. The height of the panel is 9ft and it has a 46-inch interactive panel. NDMC has also kept the business part in mind as the panel also has 75-inch LED screen for advertisement. While the process of installing of the panel has just begun , the civic body will come up more such panels with several other attractive features.As per the plan, the panels will soon be seen in Sansad Marg, Lodhi Colony, Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar, Mandi House, Bengali Market, India Gate and Gole Market.Earlier, Kumar had asserted that the NDMC\xe2\x80\x99s smart city projects will be completed before the 2020 deadline. The NDMC also said that it has set up solar panels with 3.30 MW of power generation capacity on building roofs. Of the Rs 1,800 crore Smart City Plan of the civic body, work on a range of major projects began in phases by October last year, according to reports.These projects include setting up of a unified command and control centre, multi-level parking at Khan Market, public bike sharing, sewage treatment plants, redesign of 13 roads totalling 31 kms, including seven leading to Connaught Place. Implementation of other projects will begin by March next year.

But it\'s now July, and guess what? The jingle is still popping up and creeping out New Yorkers.

Is it a protest by anti-surveillance activists against data companies encroaching upon our streets? Or is this the kind of prank that can only be cured by exorcism? What is LinkNYC not telling us?

Someone is going around New York, fiddling with the city\xe2\x80\x99s public LinkNYC internet booths, and making them blare out ice cream van music according to social media posts and LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone hacked the internet kiosk in front of my apartment and it\xe2\x80\x99s been playing the ice cream truck song for hours,\xe2\x80\x9d Chelsea Hassler, vice president and editorial director at communications agency Zeno Group, tweeted on Monday. LinkNYC confirmed the incident to Motherboard, but noted that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hack in a technical sense.Instead, LinkNYC told Motherboard in an email, people are using a booth\xe2\x80\x99s phone app to call a number\xe2\x80\x94where the person on the other end presumably plays their ice cream van music of choice\xe2\x80\x94and then pressing the home button on the booth to hide the call in progress.Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.LinkNYC has installed over a thousand of its booths across New York, which offer free Wi-Fi and other communication services. Critics have pointed to these devices\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99s potential for snooping because they include, with cameras and Bbluetooth beacons. Notably, LinkNYC added that it has deployed a feature that disables a call after 10 minutes if callers don\xe2\x80\x99t confirm they are present and using the booth. So, if the booths have been blasting out the music for hours as reported, perhaps someone is walking up and down New York making sure the devices don\xe2\x80\x99t hang up. Hassler added in another tweet that several booths were affected. LinkNYC told Motherboard that free access to its services does not mean that everyone is going to use the booths responsibly.SHARETWEETTagged:techMotherboardIce CreamNew YorkHackingheatwavePrankstersphreakingLinkNYCStoriesNewsletters are the new newsletters.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.Subscribe", b"Cruel pranksters made NYC internet kiosks play ice cream truck tunes\nEngadget\nLogin\nHome\nGear\nGaming\nEntertainment\nTomorrow\nBuyer's Guide\n2019 Camera Guide\nParenting and Tech\nBest of CES 2019\nPhones\nLaptops\nView All\nVideo\nReviews\nLog in\nSign up\nShow More Results\nEngadget\n3 related articles\nLogin\nYouTube tests moving comments to a separate window on mobile\nA new tool detects deepfakes with 96 percent accuracy\nHold the phone: Chevy owners can order Domino's with their car\nLatest in Gear\nYouTube tests moving comments to a separate window on mobile\n51m ago\nView\nFEMA's presidential alerts are an easy target for spoofing attacks\n1h ago\nView\nA new tool detects deepfakes with 96 percent accuracy\n1h ago\nView\nNew York Senate passes ban on Elon Musk's Not-A-Flamethrower\n2h ago\nView\nImage credit: John Taggart/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nsave\nSave\nshare\nCruel pranksters made NYC internet kiosks play ice cream truck tunes\nIt's deliciously evil.\nJon Fingas, @jonfingas\n07.03.18\nin Internet\nComments\n600\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nSave\nSponsored Links\nJohn Taggart/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nNew York City is in the midst of a heatwave, and some pranksters are taking advantage of technology to twist the knife a little more.\nLinkNYC has confirmed to Motherboard that someone is making its internet kiosks play ice cream truck music, taunting hapless New Yorkers looking for a cold treat on a hot day.\nIt's incredibly cruel (or wonderfuly clever, if you're the mischievous sort), but there's no hacking involved.\nThe perpetrators phone a kiosk, play the mouthwatering tunes from their phone, and switch to the kiosk's home screen to hide that there's a call in progress.\nThere aren't any known suspects, but whoever it is may have accomplices.\nThe pranks have lasted for hours at a time, but kiosks automatically end calls after 10 minutes if you don't confirm that you're present.\nIn other words, someone nearby may be keeping the calls alive by surreptitiously confirming that non-existent presence and walking off.It's not certain what LinkNYC or the city can do, especially when the heat is expected to break (if only just) within a few days.\nIt's entirely likely that the culprits will get away with their dessert-themed devilry, and LinkNYC can't guarantee that every caller is on the up-and-up.\nFor now, you'll just have to be wary about chasing down treats in the Big Apple -- you might want to order from the comfort of home instead.this one's from down the street yesterday pic.twitter.com/5qReXIZN4y\xe2\x80\x94 chelsea adelaine hassler (@chelseaadelaine) July 2, 2018\nSource:\nMotherboard\nIn this article:\ngadgetry,\ngadgets,\ngear,\nicecream,\nicecreamtruck,\ninternet,\nkiosk,\nlinknyc,\nnewyorkcity,\nprank,\nvideo,\nwi-fi,\nwifi\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The same can be said for music played from ice cream trucks, in which it is a sound recognized by many of all ages across many generations.AdvertisingUnfortunately over in NYC, it seems that a cruel prankster has decided to hack the city\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC internet booths by making them play ice cream van music. In a report from Motherboard, LinkNYC has confirmed that this is happening, although they noted that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a \xe2\x80\x9chack\xe2\x80\x9d to begin with. Apparently people are using the booth\xe2\x80\x99s phone app to call a number, and that person will then play ice cream van music and hide the call in progress so that on first glance, it will be hard to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.Given that the city is experiencing a heat wave we can only imagine how frustrating it must be for some who think that the ice cream truck is nearby, only to find out that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, plus we can imagine how annoying it must be too. According to a tweet by Chelsea Hassler, vice president and editorial director at communications agency Zeno Group, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone hacked the internet kiosk in front of my apartment and it\xe2\x80\x99s been playing the ice cream truck song for hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFiled in General.

It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a statement he regrets making so definitively, after the Daily News reported that more than 820 children under age 5 (plus 40 more identified since yesterday) tested positive for elevated lead levels in their blood since the year 2012. Just 19 cases had previously been disclosed, and the city\xe2\x80\x99s health department had only informed the Housing Authority of 68 children with elevated blood lead levels tested between 2010 to 2015.Finding out whether the mayor regrets that November statement, or his thoughts on the previously unreported cases of possible lead poisoning, proved difficult Monday, after the mayor refused to answer questions on the issue at his only public event, before departing on a vacation to Vermont, and then Canada. He took a page from Gov. Andrew Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s book and chose to address the controversy through a venue he tightly controlled, in a phone interview with a single news outlet, NY1. De Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s top staff have reminded reporters for years that the mayor has a right to some time off, in a job that never really ends. But there were multiple instances Monday in which the administration seemed particularly leaderless on some of the most pressing issues facing the city. On Monday, officials at NYCHA and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene appeared to have conflicting data and approaches to identifying children with elevated blood levels due to different lead exposure reporting levels used by city agencies, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Amanda Eisenberg reports. City officials weren\xe2\x80\x99t just on separate pages when it came to NYCHA \xe2\x80\x94 they were also very publicly at odds over whether the city plans to mandate a minimum wage for Uber and other ride-hail app drivers, as a spokesman for the mayor undermined one of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s senior commissioners on the issue on Twitter. A New Yorker profile published Monday revealed, too, that de Blasio has yet to meet with Andy Byford, the man hired to overhaul the city\xe2\x80\x99s subway system nearly eight months ago. The subway system faces a massive capital repair backlog and debilitating structural problems. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a serious source of grievance for all commuting New Yorkers for more than a year. A spokesman for the mayor tweeted yesterday that the mayor has plans to meet Byford on July. After he gets back from vacation.IT\xe2\x80\x99S TUESDAY. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts?

They know that rush-hour subway service will be maddeningly slow. They realize that the Mets will lose key players to the disabled list. And they assume that Assemblyman RIchard Gottfried will run for re-election every two years. But while the subways and the Mets are capable of upsetting expectations, in theory anyway, Gottfried has no intention of doing so. He has stood for election in his Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen and Chelsea-area district 24 times beginning in 1970. And he\'s doing it again this year. Assuming he wins \xe2\x80\x94 that outcome isn\xe2\x80\x99t really in doubt \xe2\x80\x94 and finishes his term, he\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the record books as one of only two legislators in New York history to serve for half a century.

During the response, Clark was fatally shot. \xe2\x80\xa6 The suspect, 43-year-old Steven Kiley, was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Fiore said.

Let\xe2\x80\x99s put our money where our mouth is,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Cuomo said, announcing an economic development package of $1 billion. \xe2\x80\x98That is a big \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 standing for Buffalo and standing for billion.\xe2\x80\x99 Sure enough, the money soon started to flow to Buffalo, leading to new waterfront parks, gleaming modern factories and a cluster of medical and technology facilities. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat seeking a third term in November, has repeatedly extolled the plan and the nearly $1.5 billion invested so far, asking for and receiving an additional $500 million last year. But an examination of the plans and progress of projects included in the Buffalo Billion reveals a far more uneven return on investment to date: a mix of street-level successes, expensive brick-and-mortar gambles and ill-conceived misfires.\xe2\x80\x9d Read more here\nA message from PhRMA:\n86% of AARP members support the administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule to reform the rebate system in Medicare Part D, according to a nationwide Morning Consult survey.

Chow seemed \xe2\x80\x9cunder a lot of stress,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnny said. (He asked that his surname be omitted to protect his children\'s privacy.) "He was complaining about not making his payments, how he\xe2\x80\x99s going down, and constantly working, and so tired,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnny said. Chow, 56, was one of at least six cab-drivers to commit suicide in the last seven months.Five years ago, plans were afoot to establish a \xe2\x80\x9cstress management hotline\xe2\x80\x9d specifically for taxi drivers. The hotline would have been funded through a 6-cent surcharge on each fare. That money would have gone to a fund for a host of services, including the hotline, disability insurance, and assistance for drivers navigating the Affordable Care Act. The surcharge and the benefits it was designed to provide were defeated in court by powerful taxi interests who argued the city lacked the authority to establish it in the first place. Now yellow taxi owner-drivers are in an industry facing gale-force headwinds. The rise of Uber and other app-based services has caused the value of a taxi medallion to plummet, and cab drivers across the city are struggling to come to grips with that new reality. After a spate of suicides \xe2\x80\x94 one very public \xe2\x80\x94 the de Blasio administration is working with drivers to form a new plan, one tailored to their needs.

In the coming weeks, the city\'s chief taxi regulator had planned to ask for Taxi and Limousine Commission authorization of a $17.22 minimum wage, after expenses, for drivers affiliated with the big four taxi apps in New York City \xe2\x80\x94 Uber, Lyft, Via and June. Together, they provide nearly 600,000 trips a day. But after a TLC-commissioned analysis of its proposal was released Monday, the mayor\'s office hesitated and indicated it wanted the City Council and the mayor\'s office to spearhead some other sort of regulatory effort instead. "Very premature," tweeted de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips. Read more here. Councilman pushing garbage bill linked to controversial trash hauler \xe2\x80\x94 Crains\xe2\x80\x99s Will Bredderman: \xe2\x80\x9cThe battle over the future of commercial waste carting is getting messy. A politician pushing a bill friendly to the troubled industry has family links to one of its most controversial businesses: Sanitation Salvage, the Bronx-based hauler cited by critics as exemplifying why waste haulers must be reined in. Mayor Bill de Blasio and his allies on the City Council hope to divide the city into zones, where businesses would have to choose from two to five vendors (rather than dozens) to take away their trash. Councilmen Robert Cornegy and Mark Gjonaj have sought to head it off with legislation forbidding the administration from carving out such districts. As it happens, Gjonaj\xe2\x80\x99s brother was until recently in business with the Squitieri family, which owns Sanitation Salvage. State Liquor Authority records show that from 2015 until last month, brothers Steve and John Squitieri each owned a 9% stake in Jemi LLC, which did business at 565 City Island Ave. under a succession of names, including the Lighthouse, Vistamar Restaurant and Don Coqui on the Water. During that period, Paul Gjonaj\xe2\x80\x94who had previously been the limited liability company\'s sole owner\xe2\x80\x94held a 41% share in the entity.\xe2\x80\x9d Read it here \xe2\x80\x9cDead of AIDS and Forgotten in Potter\xe2\x80\x99s Field: In an untold chapter of the AIDS epidemic, scores of unclaimed bodies were buried in a remote spot on Hart Island. How many exactly remains unclear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 New York Times\xe2\x80\x99s Corey Kilgannon: \xe2\x80\x9cThe bodies reached Hart Island on a ferry like all the others, in spare wooden boxes and bound for ignominious mass internment off the coast of the Bronx where New York City buries its unclaimed dead by the hundreds in long, shallow trenches. But when these 17 bodies arrived in 1985, the island\xe2\x80\x99s hardened crews, used to burying dozens of indigent people per week, recoiled. These were different. They had died from a widely feared nascent disease called AIDS, a highly contagious illness with a skyrocketing death toll. The bodies were kept out of the trenches and instead quarantined in a remote spot on the island\xe2\x80\x99s southernmost tip, buried deep in individual graves... The island would go on to receive scores, if not hundreds, of people who died during the AIDS epidemic, which during the 1980s and 1990s killed more than 100,000 people in New York, about a quarter of AIDS deaths nationwide during the same period. Trying to pin down the precise number of those with AIDS buried on Hart Island is difficult. A longstanding stigma about the island and criticism that the burial practices are crude and outdated have made city officials reluctant to provide many details. Officials at several city agencies involved in the burials refused interview requests to discuss the issue and insisted that no data or any other information was available on AIDS burials.\xe2\x80\x9d Read it here \xe2\x80\x94SEATTLE BANS PLASTIC STRAWS \xe2\x80\x94 Fox News\xe2\x80\x99s Kaitlyn Schallhorn: \xe2\x80\x9cSeattle has officially become the first major U.S. city to ban restaurants from giving plastic straws and utensils to customers in an effort to help the environment. Since July 1, restaurants in the Emerald City are barred from providing customers plastic straws, cocktail picks or utensils unless someone specifically requests one. In that case, the customer should be given a compostable option, according to Seattle Public Utilities.With 5,000 food service providers in the area, Seattle is the first major city in the U.S. to enact such a ban, KIRO-TV reported. \xe2\x80\x9cPlastic pollution is surpassing crisis levels in the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud Seattle is leading the way and setting an example for the nation by enacting a plastic straw ban,\xe2\x80\x9d Mami Hara, the general manager of Seattle Public Utilities, told KOMO News.\xe2\x80\x9d Read more here \xe2\x80\x94GO AHEAD AND JUMP IN THE FOUNTAIN \xe2\x80\x94 Gothamist\xe2\x80\x99s Jen Carlson: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\'s this goddamn hot outside, Washington Square Park\xe2\x80\x99s fountain calls to you like a siren.

But once Schumer bowed out, citing an equipment problem that kept his small plane grounded upstate, the frustration reached a simmer that matched the day\xe2\x80\x99s sweltering temperature. After spending nearly a year pressuring the Senate minority leader to meet with his constituents, liberal organizers scrambled to press Schumer to reschedule and not rely on a teleconference that was hastily assembled for him to take their questions.

One possibility would be for Trump to hold out a Round 2 meeting as a carrot to encourage real movement by North Korea over the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d Read more here. \xe2\x80\x94HELPFUL: \xe2\x80\x9cNPR\xe2\x80\x99s Ari Shapiro speaks with Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, about how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement works and how its structured.\xe2\x80\x9d Listen here SOCIAL DATA: HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Sandra Lee, \xe2\x80\x9cNew York\xe2\x80\x99s First Lady\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 Lally Weymouth ...

Brooklyn\'s Robert Cornegy is the 42nd Council member to sign a bill that would require monthly reports from Airbnb and similar companies about their booked listings. Any rental shielded from disclosure to the Mayor\'s Office of Special Enforcement would carry a fine of up to $25,000. Cornegy said he chose to sign the bill after he felt confident he had enough support to pass a separate measure he is sponsoring that would exempt single and two-family homes from enforcement against illegal hotels. He is so far the only sponsor listed on that bill, but believes it will pass and provide enough protection for homeowners in his Bed-Stuy district to justify his endorsement of the reporting requirements.

This time the kiosks have been programmed to play ice cream van chimes, leaving parched punters searching in vain for a Whippy treat.\nsomeone hacked the internet kiosk in front of my apartment and it\'s been playing the ice cream truck song for hours\n\xe2\x80\x94 chelsea adelaine hassler (@chelseaadelaine) July 2, 2018\nMotherboard has had a confirmation from LinkNYC that, yes, it\'s really a thing, but\xc2\xa0it\'s denying its an actual hack and besides, free stuff gets abused all the time.\nWhat\'s actually happening is that people are using the booth to make a call to a number that plays ice cream van music. Then, by hitting the home button, it disguises the call.\nSuch japes.\nBut as pointed out, calls to these booths are supposed to auto-hang after\xc2\xa010 minutes. Some residents are talking of chimes lasting "hours", so isn\'t adding up there - either the witnesses are lying or the booths are malfunctioning. Either way, it may not be a conventional hack but it\'s a pretty impressive troll.\nLinkNYC and other schemes like it have faced criticism for the booths which contain a very open infrastructure of wifi and Bluetooth, which, as much as it represents a public service, is also ready for abuse and hacking.\nBut if the worst they can dish out is a bit of porn and some ice cream noises, the future of the Western world is probably safe for now. \xce\xbc\nTweet\nFacebook\nSend to\nTopics\nSecurity\nSecurity\nHacking\nice cream\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nINQ Latest\nDell SupportAssist vuln could leave millions of PCs open to exploits\nThe flaw might affect more than just Dell machines\nSecurity\n21 June 2019\n10 things we learnt about Google this week: Page 0, Slated, Duo Liebe\nThings that happened at Google you may have missed\nHardware\n21 June 2019\nLoudMiner cryptomining malware targets powerful audio creation PCs\nPirate commercial software at your own risk\nSecurity\n21 June 2019\nJava and JavaScript remain the most popular programming languages\nAnd devs are using Google Cloud more than Azure\nSoftware\n21 June 2019\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nBack to Top\nMost read\nModder demos Nvidia Shield-enhanced Android running on a Nintendo Switch\nGalaxy Note 10 release date, price and specs: Cases confirm barely-there bezels and Sound on Display\nRogue Raspberry Pi allowed hackers to infiltrate NASA\'s systems\niPhone 11 release date, specs and price: iPhone 11 Max accessories confirm square camera bump\nMicrosoft will use machine learning to force Windows 10 updates\nContact\nMarketing solutions\nEnterprise IT Events\nIncisive Media\nTerms & conditions\nPolicies\nCareers\nRSS\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nYouTube\n\xc2\xa9 Incisive Business Media (IP) Limited, Published by Incisive Business Media Limited, New London House, 172 Drury Lane, London WC2B 5QR, registered in England and Wales with company registration numbers 09177174 & 09178013\nDigital publisher of the year\nDigital publisher of the year 2010, 2013, 2016 & 2017', b"Tribeca Citizen |\nSpring Studios Wants to Expand Its Rooftop Usage\nLeft rectangle ads redesignedCategories\nArts & Culture\nCommunity News\nConstruction\nCrime\nEvents\nFitness / Spas / Salons\nHistory\nKids\nMiscellany\nNewsletter\nParks\nPeople\nPhoto Essay\nReal Estate\nRestaurant/Bar News\nSchools\nServices\nShopping\nSponsored\nLeft column house adsFuture Openings\nFuture Openings\nSavida restaurant\nDowntown Yogurt\nAu Cheval restaurant\nNova Fitness\nWarren Street Japanese restaurant\nLuv Michael\nLos Tacos No. 1\nJames Cohan Gallery\nJournal Gallery\nRumble Boxing\nFarra wine bar\nSant Ambroeus restaurant\nBuddha Bar\nAssunta Madre\nWalker Hotel Tribeca / Blue Bottle\nMartignetti Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 bar\nNo. 87 restaurant\nNew York Vintners indoor farm\nSoho Diner\nThe Wonder family caf\xc3\xa9\nTorishin yakitori restaurant\n456 Greenwich hotel\nAlamo Drafthouse\nT-shirt image\nHistory of Tribeca Buildings\nSpring Studios Wants to Expand Its Rooftop Usage\nJuly 5, 2018 \xe2\x80\xa2 Community News, Real Estate, Restaurant/Bar News\nFrom Community Board 1\xe2\x80\xa6.

Additionally, advertisements in PATH trains and stations feature exclusive creative detailing a NYC Restaurant Week manifesto.Visitors who really, really love what they\xe2\x80\x99re eating should take a moment to memorialize their meal on social media.

This digital exhibit is a follow up to the release of their book, \xe2\x80\x98Never Built New York,\xe2\x80\x99 which came out in 2016, and their subsequent exhibition at the Queens Museum last fall.\nIn the LinkNYC partnership, these never built projects will be displayed as close as possible to their would be locations in the city. Take for instance I.M. Pei\xe2\x80\x99s Hyperboloid, a 102-story circular tower that would have replaced Grand Central Terminal, and would have been the tallest structure in the world\xe2\x80\x94that will be visible on LinkNYC kiosks near the station.\nOther never built structures that have received recognition on LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s digital billboards include Moshe Safdie\xe2\x80\x99s Habitat New York 1, an origami-like luxury residence and shopping complex proposed to rise north of Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side; and the domed stadium designed by Buckminster Fuller, that would have kept the Dodgers in Brooklyn. Peek at some of the others below.\nThis is LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s latest collaboration following ones with the Museum of the City of New York in March, to honor women activists; and the one with the Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS) last year to show off historic photos of NYC neighborhoods.\nThe New York City transit projects that never were\nHelp bring a \xe2\x80\x98Never Built New York\xe2\x80\x99 exhibit to life at the Queens Museum\nNext Up In\nNews\nNew York Botanical Garden\xe2\x80\x99s stinky corpse flower will bloom soon\nDigital billboards should be banned from NYC waterways: lawmakers\nNew York lawmakers vote to legalize e-bikes, e-scooters\nInfamous landlord to pay $3M in tenant harassment settlement\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nBrooklyn lawmaker wants to resurrect Triboro rail line\nMost Read\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nThe apartment where the late rapper grew up is up for grabs\nWhat $1M buys in NYC right now\nFive apartments, five NYC neighborhoods\nWilliamsburg\xe2\x80\x99s quirky shipping container house lists for $5.5M\nThe home on a corner lot is made up of 21 shipping containers meticulously pieced together\nBrooklyn lawmaker wants to resurrect Triboro rail line\nThe rail line would connect the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn\nLovely Ditmas Park townhouse with a huge pool asks $2M\nThe landmarked Brooklyn home has a ton of "old world charm."\nSign up for the\nCurbed NY Newsletter\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 33.

It might sound like a dream to many New Yorkers, until the public learned that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d at all. LinkNYC, a communications network that is replacing public pay phones with WiFi kiosks across New York City, is paid for by advertising that tracks users, festooned with cameras and microphones, and has questionable processes for allowing the public to influence its data handling policies.\nThese kiosks also gave birth to ReThink LinkNYC, a grassroots community group that\xe2\x80\x99s uniting New Yorkers from different backgrounds in standing up for their privacy. In a recent interview with EFF, organizers Adsila Amani and Mari Dej described the organization as a \xe2\x80\x9chodgepodge of New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x9d who were shocked by the surveillance-fueled WiFi kiosks entering their neighborhoods. More importantly, they saw opportunity. As Dej described, \xe2\x80\x9cAs we began scratching the surface, [we] saw that this was an opportunity as well to highlight some of the problems that are largely invisible with data brokers and surveillance capitalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\nReThink LinkNYC, which has launched an informational website and hosts events across New York, has been pushing city officials for transparency and accountability. They have demanded a halt to construction on the kiosks until adequate privacy safeguards are enacted.\nThe group has already had some successes. As Dej described it, \xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly got the attention of LinkNYC, and that itself is a victory \xe2\x80\x93 [they] know that there is an organized group of everyday peeps unhappy with the lack of transparency around the LinkNYC 'spy kiosks.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut Amani cautioned that it was too early to know whether early changes in response to the group\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy\xe2\x80\x94including a revised LinkNYC privacy policy, the creation of a Chief Privacy Officer role for the city, and a new city taskforce\xe2\x80\x94will actually advance the privacy concerns of New Yorkers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would like to see the end of individualized tracking of location, faces, and all biometric data on the kiosks,\xe2\x80\x9d Amani offered, \xe2\x80\x9cWith LinkNYC having the means to collect this data and still not having figured out the path for community oversight of the hardware and software, it\xe2\x80\x99s saying trust us, we won't hurt you. That's naive, especially in these times.\xe2\x80\x9d\nReThink LinkNYC has thrived in part because it actively cultivated partnerships, and not just with the tech community. Dej noted, \xe2\x80\x9cInasmuch as the structure of surveillance affects us all, all of us deserve to be aware, and welcomed into action.\xc2\xa0 A movement needs to extend beyond the tech community.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo other groups around the country that might be interesting in campaigning to defend civil liberties in their own communities, Amani advised organizers to examine the power structures they are opposing and cultivate personal connections: \xe2\x80\x9cCivic involvement remains a more or less fringe activity for a majority of people.\xc2\xa0 So appeal to what human community is\xe2\x80\x94feelings of connection, acceptance, creating a safe world for our children, and a chance to be creative, 'seen', and given a sense that one\xe2\x80\x99s participation is valued. If we'd like our tech future to be cooperative (versus dominated by wealth or authoritarian styles), then that's how we organize.\xc2\xa0 If we dedicate ourselves to unlearning the hierarchical behavioral model, we can more easily sense our power.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDej agreed, adding \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the power, we just have yet to realize it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nReThink LinkNYC joined the Electronic Frontier Alliance (EFA) over a year ago, and has used the network to help connect with other digital rights activists in New York City, get assistance with event promotion, and discuss strategies.

A number of the much-hyped current technologies made appearances in fiction \xe2\x80\x94 often science fiction \xe2\x80\x94 before their real-life debuts in smart cities.\nSmart Cities Dive has compiled a list of 10 times fiction predicted smart city advances. These examples might not be the very first known mentions of such technologies in all cases, but they are among the most prominent references.\n"Wandl the Invader" (book, 1939) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: Hyperloop transportation\nInnovative transportation is a frequently addressed theme in science fiction, especially considering how often the stories involve space travel. This book by Ray Cummings envisioned high-speed transportation in vacuum cylinders,\xc2\xa0\xc3\xa0 la pneumatic mail tubes.\nThis is a rudimentary example of the hyperloop, Elon Musk\'s concept for underground pod transportation inside a partial vacuum tube system. Although hyperloop has yet to officially come to fruition, preliminary construction on testing facilities has launched in France, joining those in Nevada and California. Hyperloop designs even mimic the book\'s idea of only having a few people travel in each small pod, as opposed to running an entire train through the vacuum tube system at once.\n"1984" (book, 1949) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: video surveillance, data collection/analytics\nElements of the dystopian novel\'s language \xe2\x80\x94 such as "Big Brother" \xe2\x80\x94 have been well integrated into modern society\'s vernacular. Although it depicts negative elements of technology, it nonetheless proved visionary in predicting future technology and related practices.\nGeorge Orwell\'s characters were monitored by "telescreens" both at home and in public that transmitted sound and video to Big Brother. Similarly, modern cities use public video surveillance for numerous purposes, including law enforcement, emergency responses and optimizing traffic flow. But cities also must strike a balance between beneficial surveillance and invading residents\' privacy, as highlighted in the book. Oakland, CA is among the municipalities moving forward with strict regulations\xc2\xa0governing the city\'s use of surveillance technology.\nThe book also delved into data collection and a primitive form of data analytics, in that residents\' personal information constantly was collected and analyzed for compliance. Those who weren\'t in compliance with the rules were punished. Interestingly, many people drew parallels between the book\'s data collection methods and the controversy surrounding the National Security Agency (NSA) when it was exposed as collecting information from U.S. citizens\' emails and phone calls; sales of 1984 spiked in 2013 during the NSA dustup.\n"Stand on Zanzibar"(book, 1969) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: electric cars\nThe main theme in John Brunner\'s book is that the world\'s population is growing rapidly and overpopulation brings negative consequences, some of which the book aims to predict. Notably, modern municipal leaders and planners work to avoid some of the named consequences, such as widening social divides, to prevent their city\'s de-stabilization.\nThe book envisions a world where people increasingly travel in cars powered by rechargeable electric fuel cells. Although widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs) has had several stops and starts in the United States over the past 20 years, it\'s really picking up steam now.\nSome examples include GM promising to release more EV models, Atlanta passing legislation requiring EV charging infrastructure in new buildings,\xc2\xa0the Department of Energy is funding fast EV charging research\xc2\xa0and a plethora of cities adding both public charging stations and electric battery-fueled public transportation. One main difference is that real-life EV acceptance is a bit behind the book, which was set in 2010.\n"Knight Rider" (TV show, 1982) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles\nThe 1980s were chock full of attention to Trans Ams, but KITT was the most coveted by people young and old. The vehicle used artificial intelligence to communicate verbally with its owner, Michael Knight. That was revolutionary considering how few cars at the time had onboard computer systems, which are standard in modern vehicles.\nKITT not only communicated with Michael, but also with its surroundings. It could operate its own systems and override human operations to become a fully autonomous vehicle. KITT\'s functions resemble in many ways the modern autonomous vehicles (AVs) being tested around the world and how they communicate with their surroundings via sensors to influence operations. However, thus far the artificial intelligence is not advanced enough to carry on full conversations with humans.\n"WarGames" (movie, 1983) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: cybersecurity, hacking\nNearly a decade before most people had even heard of the internet, much less used it, "War Games" exposed the dangers of a connected world, specifically that one small technical misunderstanding nearly caused a global nuclear war.\nThe main character is a hacker, which is a commonly used term today, but 35 years ago the concept was largely unknown.\xc2\xa0The movie offered,\xc2\xa0debatably, the first ever mainstream reference to the term "firewall." Although watching the movie now uncovers some discrepancies in how connectivity and hacking actually work, it did illustrate the need for cybersecurity, especially for government systems.\n"Neuromancer" (book, 1984) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: cyberspace, hacking\nWilliam Gibson\'s book published shortly after "War Games" was released and included a common theme: The main character, Case, is a hacker. Two years prior, Gibson released a short story that is credited as the first to coin the term "cyberspace," which he folded into Neuromancer. The novel also introduced the concept of virtual reality headsets, and artificial intelligence takes center stage throughout.\nThe internet and connectivity serve as the backbone for nearly all smart city technology, and protecting against hackers who could disrupt the entire system therefore is essential. Cities are starting to look at new, more secure developments such as blockchain-based cybersecurity to avoid large-scale hacks like the one that brought Atlanta\'s system to its proverbial knees.\n"Back to the Future Part II" (movie, 1989) \xe2\x80\x94 Predicted: Drones\nThis movie introduced a slew of iconic technologies, some of which worked out while others remain just ideas. Drones are the technology most pertinent to the smart cities space. During the portions of the movie set in the future \xe2\x80\x94 in 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 news organizations use photo- and video-capturing drones called "hovercams"\xc2\xa0to report on events and transmit live news feeds.\nBy the time 2015 rolled around in reality, drones were all the rage as a hot, new tech item. Their use expands constantly and they\'re currently employed in a variety of smart city applications including inspecting\xc2\xa0infrastructure, detecting gun shots, chasing criminals\xc2\xa0and assessing traffic accidents.\n"Total Recall" (movie, 1990)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Predicted: artificial intelligence, autonomous taxis\nSimilar to "Knight Rider," "Total Recall" features an autonomous vehicle (AV) that communicates with human passengers. Granted, the communication with Johnny Cab, the oft-maligned and "disturbing" humanoid robot that operates the car, is far less smooth than with KITT and creates frustration.\nTotal Recall advances the AV concept and makes it applicable to areas other than just personal vehicles. A number of companies like Nissan and GM are testing autonomous taxis\xc2\xa0and AV ride-sharing services, and cities including Houston, TX and Columbus, OH\xc2\xa0recently launched pilot programs to test AV shuttles as a greater mobility option.\n"The Fifth Element"\xc2\xa0(movie, 1997)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Predicted:\xc2\xa03D printing\nScientists in the movie use a high-tech 3D printer to construct Leeloo\'s body piece-by-piece from the inside out using recovered DNA.\n3D printers were beginning to emerge in niche markets during the 1990s, but the early models were a far cry from today\'s advanced machinery. Although real-life 3D printers thus far have not advanced to the point of creating entire living beings like in "The Fifth Element," they hold promise for constructing cities\' infrastructure including bridges, bus stops, offices and homes.\n"Minority Report" (movie, 2002)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Predicted: predictive analytics, targeted advertising\nThe movie featured numerous futuristic technologies, but one that particularly gained notoriety for being simultaneously creepy and fascinating is the targeted advertising. Characters\' retinas are scanned when they pass billboards and various kiosks and then the technology caters the ads to each person and addresses them by name.\nMore cities are installing interactive kiosks that offer Wi-Fi and a variety of information, like maps,\xc2\xa0that could be helpful to passersby. Different cities fund the devices and their operations in different ways, and New York\'s much-celebrated LinkNYC\xc2\xa0kiosks are among those funded through advertising. But as the kiosks interact with people\'s mobile devices they also collect information, including IP addresses and mobile device type, and use the collected, anonymized\xc2\xa0data to influence advertising on the kiosks. This is similar to the technique in the "Minority Report," except that the real-life kiosks scan a person\'s phone instead of their retinas.\nFollow\nKatie Pyzyk\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nEnergy & Utilities\nTransportation\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nAdobe Stock\nGet smart cities news like this in your inbox daily.

LinkNYC, the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications, AN contributor Sam Lubell, writer\xc2\xa0Greg Goldin, and publisher Metropolis Books have teamed up to bring images from Never Built New York to the city\xe2\x80\x99 streets via LinkNYC kiosks.\nThe display of unbuilt megaprojects from some of the biggest names in architecture follows the release of the Never Built New York book in 2016, and the accompanying show at the Queens Museum last fall. The kiosks won\xe2\x80\x99t display the full array of weird and wild never-realized projects, but the curated images will still depict how New York could have grown into a very different city.\nA kiosk display of Howe & Lescaze\xe2\x80\x99s unbuilt Museum of Modern Art. (Courtesy LinkNYC)\nSome of the work on display includes I.M. Pei\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for the Hyperboloid, a 102-story tower proposed in 1954 that would have replaced Grand Central, and Robert Moses\xe2\x80\x99s heavily contested Mid-Manhattan Expressway. Images of the Dodger Dome, an enclosed stadium designed by Buckminster Fuller meant to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn, and Moshe Safdie\xe2\x80\x99s tessellating Habitat New York (originally slated for the Upper East Side) have also been selected. LinkNYC will display images of each project on kiosks close to the location where they would have risen.\nA kiosk display of William Zeckendorf\xe2\x80\x99s 67-block-long Dream Airport, which would have floated in the Hudson River.

Based off the 2016 book\xc2\xa0Never Built New York, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x94which supplies the city with free wifi\xe2\x80\x94is collaborating with curators and authors Greg Goldin and Sam Lubell to highlight some of the fantastical structures that appeared in their book, and almost graced the city\'s famous skyline.\nWhile never actualized, many of these unbuilt plans for towers, bridges and parks, hold a unique place within architectural history and its collective imagination. Memorable proposals such as Moshe Safdie\'s \'Habitat New York\', Robert Moses\' Mid-Manhattan Expressway, and I.M Pei\'s \'Hyperbloid\', are some of the works that will be on display. Placed on kiosks near the location they would have risen, the posters show what could\'ve been, reminding passersby it\'s okay to dream.\nSimilar articles on Archinect that may interest you...\n"Show audiences that it\'s okay to dream" by Kickstarting Never Built New York\nOne-to-One #45 with \'Never Built New York\' authors Greg Goldin and Sam Lubell\n"Never Built New York" catalogues alternative visions of the City\n"Unbuilt SF" showcases past and future Bay Area architecture projects\nBack to Never Land: Chicago exhibition honors remarkable never-builts\nThe NYC that could have been \xe2\x80\x93 \'Never Built New York\' to be released this fall\nTagged\nnever built new yorknever builtnew yorklinknyc\nBack to Top \xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x91\n1 Comment\nChemex\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHistory\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb7\xc2\xa0Contact\nI\xc2\xa0saw this today and it switched before I could read it.

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls\xc2\xa0or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What are the main features the kiosks offer?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How do they improve the lives of residents?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What type of ads do the kiosks display?Fasoldt:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do the kiosks use any analytics?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?Fastold:\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model. In addition to New York, a Link network is live in the U.K.\xc2\xa0We have planned expansions into Philadelphia and Newark, with many more cities on the way.Topics: Customer Experience, Government, Interactive / Touchscreen, Outdoor Kiosks, Software, Wayfinding / Information Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

This article has been updated for our August print edition to reflect new developments. It was originally published on July 18 .\nJohn Bolger Jul 18, 2018\nIssue 238\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that the MTA website is as decrepit as the signals directing it\xe2\x80\x99s trains. But then again, the MTA website is not very good at keeping secrets. If you have used TripPlanner, Subway Times or Bus Times, customer service, filed a FOIL request or a sexual harassment complaint, if you have submitted personal information through any of these MTA web portals, your data \xe2\x80\x94 such as name, email address, username, password, postal address, phone number, photo uploads, text entries and travel details \xe2\x80\x94 has been exposed to countless third-parties, for many years.\nThis is because the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s website did not use encryption when transmitting your private information. As a result, any data submitted to the MTA website could have been read by third parties whose networks your private information passed through on its way to the MTA.\nIn general, the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s web offerings are all insecure at this time except for the My MTA Alerts, MTA Employment Opportunity and EasyPay portals, which all use encryption to protect visitors. After being notified of the leak, the MTA has since secured the customer service and the third-party developer portals.\nFor web traffic, secure transmission is known as \xe2\x80\x9cHTTPS.\xe2\x80\x9d Without HTTPS, there is no privacy or assurance on the web. This is because the internet is basically a network of relays between you and the physical locations of requested web servers. This means a lot of strangers handle your web requests. Without encryption, private data sent over the web can be spied upon or tampered with by any of these third parties. HTTPS thwarts these types of attacks.\nIt is impossible to count the number of third parties who have had access to your data, and it is impossible to know if any of them read or harvested your data, but a short list of these third parties includes internet service providers and phone companies (Verizon, AT&T, Time Warner Cable), WiFi providers, such as coffee shops, hotels and free providers like LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x94 even your landlord in some buildings. Also, criminal hackers and government spy agencies both foreign and domestic.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a government agency that is sending and receiving data that has a real effect on people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives, there\xe2\x80\x99s really no excuse for not using basic security techniques that are, at this point, absolutely bog standard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Parker Higgins, a computer security expert and director of special projects for Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor at least the last five years,\xe2\x80\x9d Higgins added, \xe2\x80\x9cmost government agencies are moving towards HTTPS everywhere. Within the federal government that\xe2\x80\x99s been an official, established standard for three years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSwitching to HTTPS from the nonsecure transmission line \xe2\x80\x9cHTTP\xe2\x80\x9d is easy and inexpensive. HTTPS has also recently become common among local government websites. New York City\xe2\x80\x99s various web services, from traffic ticket payment to public housing requests, are all HTTPS-secured. The state government is also up to date in this sense \xe2\x80\x94 except when it comes to the MTA.\nThe MTA website itself is not a single website per se. It is a collection of unrelated web servers located around the country that perform different functions on the website but which link to each other. Since each web server uses a uniform style, the transition from one server to the other during browsing appears seamless. TripPlanner is located in Brooklyn, Subway and Bus Times are located in Virginia, Long Island Rail Road schedule lookup is on Long Island. None of these used HTTPS at press time.\nThe largest privacy violator for years was the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s web customer service portal, which is located in Chicago on a network operated by Oracle. Traffic to and from this server was unprotected until July 16, when the MTA switched it to HTTPS after being contacted for this article a few days earlier. Last month, a simple web request to this site passed through at least 12 internet relays on its way from New York City to Chicago, according to a diagnostic tool named traceroute. This means that in addition to the MTA, 12 internet operators were able to read your username and password, and any FOIL requests (including postal address), customer service requests or sexual harassment complaints (including photo uploads and phone number) you might have filed. If you re-used passwords, the MTA customer service website could have compromised every account you used the same password for.\n\xe2\x80\x9cData that you send over HTTP can be intercepted and read by anyone on your network, including internet service providers and individuals connected to the same WiFi network as you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sydney Li, a staff technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \xe2\x80\x9cSensitive data such as personally identifiable information, passwords, or sexual harassment complaints should absolutely be sent over an HTTPS connection. When you load content over HTTP, any entity responsible for routing this content can also alter or present fake content to you. This is known as a man-in-the-middle attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\nVerizon was caught doing just that, since at least 2014, according to reports from ProPublica.\xc2\xa0 In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission fined Verizon $1.35 million for injecting \xe2\x80\x9csuper-cookies\xe2\x80\x9d into the unencrypted traffic of their mobile customers, with no way to opt out. These are tracking codes that Verizon and third parties use to monitor browsing histories and build profiles on unsuspecting web users. This type of message tampering is exactly what encryption was designed to defeat. It is not possible while using HTTPS.\nSome sections of its website are managed in-house by the MTA, others are outsourced to contractors like Oracle, which conducts the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s customer service and employment opportunity portals. Oracle is one of the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s biggest technological contractors. As of May 2017, Oracle held at least $59 million in combined contracts with the MTA until 2020, according to minutes from a board meeting where the Oracle contracts to-date were consolidated into a single umbrella contract.\nThe MTA\xe2\x80\x99s customer service website is provided to the authority via a service known as RightNow, also referred to as Oracle Cloud. This contract originates from 2002, years before RightNow was purchased by Oracle. At the time, it was offered to MTA for $112,000 per year, according to a 2011 procurement report. Oracle bought RightNow in 2012 and MTA costs have ballooned since then. In July 2014, the RightNow contract was renewed under Oracle for $190,000 a year, according to minutes from a board meeting where the RightNow contract was combined with the procurement of another Oracle service, \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Relationship Management,\xe2\x80\x9d for a combined $518,000 for two years.\nCurrently, MTA still contracts Oracle for RightNow, which as of 2017 is included in the umbrella Oracle contract. This guarantees that the costs associated with RightNow will be much harder to trace going forward.\nThe MTA developer portal, for third-party app developers, was also not encrypted, meaning developers may have had their login username and password compromised or their API keys stolen. (API keys are the credentials MTA issues to third-party app developers to grant access to proprietary data feeds, such as train schedule or location services.) Visitors applying for a developer account also had their submissions leaked, which included their name, phone number and company name. The developer servers are located in Virginia.\xc2\xa0 The MTA secured this portal as of July 25.\nOn July 2, the MTA unveiled a pre-release version of its new and redesigned website, which was a vast improvement over its current website. Commendably, the homepage and the basic text pages were secured under HTTPS. Train schedule lookups have been merged into the basic website and are now secure as well. But the new website still linked to insecure areas of the old website, such as the lost and found form, which leaked name, phone numbers, email address, postal address and travel details.\nThe MTA has since secured the lost and found form.\xc2\xa0 But other parts of the old website remained unprotected at press time, such as TripPlanner and Subway Times and Bus Times.\nDespite recent progress, the MTA violated its privacy policy for years and will continue to do so until its entire website is secured under HTTPS. The privacy policy states \xe2\x80\x9cthe MTA Agencies are strongly committed to protecting personal information collected through the MTA Website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure \xe2\x80\xa6 MTA Agencies have implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of their information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authenticating \xe2\x80\xa6 and encrypting. Security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of the MTA Website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter the initial web publication of this report on July 18, an MTA spokesperson emailed The Indypendent the following statement: \xe2\x80\x9cThe MTA currently uses HTTPS and encryption for all ecommerce apps to protect customer data associated with financial transactions, and our technicians are working on remaining sections of the legacy website and expect to have that patched within days. There has been no evidence of data leak or breach of any information from the MTA website to date.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, the nature of this type of data leak means that the mere occurrence of data transmission to the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s insecure servers is evidence itself that the leak has occurred. Since the leak occurs via the act of transmission itself, the MTA has no control over who reads or saves that leaked data. If a third party abused its access to the data, then the evidence would rest with that third party, not the MTA.\nAnd despite its assurance that technicians were patching the data breaches on its \xe2\x80\x9clegacy website,\xe2\x80\x9d many areas of the website remained leaking as The Indy went to press.\nThis is reader-supported news.

For example, smart cities are using tools such as kiosks, digital signage and sensors to analyze traffic flows to improve services.Another story analyzed how to effectively measure digital signage ROI, by looking at engagement, experience and other objectives.You can read more on these topics by reading these top five stories for June 2018. They are posted in reverse order.5. 3 ways digital signage can deliver improved communication at the workplaceIf we are completely honest, we have to admit we regularly ignore or miss important emails. A study by The Radicati Group found that in 2015, the average employee sent and received 122 emails per day. The study also expected that number to increase to 126 emails by 2019. With so many emails flying back and forth, it's easy to see why that important email regarding a company get together or a change to the 401k can go unnoticed. Perhaps a better solution to this communication overload is to provide a more convenient source of information: digital signage. There are three key ways digital signage can boost communication in the workplace: convenience, interactivity and culture.4. Smart cities deliver improved quality of lifeCities around the globe are adopting smart technologies. New York City, for example, deployed LinkNYC kiosks, which offer Wi-Fi services and advertisements to residents. Services such as these aren't just boosting Wi-Fi, they are also delivering improved quality of life.3. 3 ways airports fly high with digital signageThrough embracing digital technologies, airports have been actively exploring the tools to further shape the delivery of their overall customer experience. With customer experience remaining the primary focus, airports are capitalizing on the opportunities to provide efficient messaging, real time information, personalized services and self-service. Airports are keen to discover what's next, as the digital revolution takes flight.2. 5 future digital signage trends of 20182017 was an innovative year for digital signage, and 2018 promises to have even more going on. Both organizations and the public have embraced the digitalization of\xe2\x80\xa6well, everything\xe2\x80\xa6and they want more.1. How to measure digital signage ROIIt is essential that you have a clear idea of what exactly you want your digital signage system to achieve. Is it to improve productivity? Increase event participation? Improve the guest experience? Boost online interactions? Your goal has to be relevant and measurable, and shouldn't be simply to give people information. Your objectives will determine both what you're going to show on digital signs and how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to judge success, so they need to be well thought out.Image via Istock.comTopics: Content, Content Management, Corporate Communication, Customer Experience, Trends / Statistics, Wayfinding Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

What would it look like? By 2050, two-thirds of the population, more than six billion people, are expected to live in urbanized areas. Exponential technologies will radically change the way we build and organize our cities in the future. In this article, I will cover mass urbanization trends, building future cities, and exponential technology implications.Considering the transformative power of exponential technologies, is it better to take a top-down approach when designing cities, or a bottom-up approach? Let\xe2\x80\x99s dive in.Mass urbanization Cities currently house over 50% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, and generate 80% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s GDP. The UN estimates that continuing urbanization and population growth will add 2.5 billion people to the world\xe2\x80\x99s urban population by 2050, with nearly 90% of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. While the city population is growing dramatically, the footprint of the city (the number of square kilometers it covers) will grow at a faster rate, ultimately causing the city densities (people per square kilometer) to decline. The expected increase in urban land during the first three decades of the 21st century will be greater than the cumulative urban expansion in all of human history.This poses a unique challenge for sustainability endeavors, as low-density cities tend to produce higher carbon emissions than higher-density cities of a similar population size. By 2050, the UN projects that demand for water and energy will increase by 55%. By 2035, the demand for energy will increase by 33%. As people migrate to cities, existing infrastructure will need to be improved, or we will face significant shortages. Technology has the potential to dramatically reduce the downsides of urbanization. With big data, ubiquitous sensors, computer intelligence, and transportation technology (autonomous cars, flying cars, Hyperloop, and so on), we can imagine central systems that are far more efficient and offer far greater performance than the ones around today.Building future citiesFour recent projects in this area have caught my eye:1. Sidewalk labsSidewalk Labs is Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s urban development organization that seeks to imagine what cities would look like if they were built \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the internet up.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2012, Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiary Intersection began converting old payphones into free, technologically advanced access points, complete with video call capability and screamingfast Wi-Fi. Over the next several years, 7,500 \xe2\x80\x9clinks\xe2\x80\x9d will be installed throughout New York City. In October 2017, Sidewalk announced its plans to build a tech-centered neighborhood southeast of downtown Toronto called Quayside. Waterfront Toronto, Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s partner in the project, said that the city will be \xe2\x80\x9ca testbed for emerging technologies, materials and processes that will address these challenges and advance solutions that can be replicated in cities worldwide.\xe2\x80\x9d2. Bill Gates & Belmont Partners Bill Gates recently announced his commitment of US$80 million to build a \xe2\x80\x9csmart city\xe2\x80\x9d just outside of Phoenix, Arizona with the help of Belmont Partners, a real estate investing group. In a press release, the company described the city as a \xe2\x80\x9cforward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x99s project in Toronto, this city would literally be built from the ground up\xe2\x80\x93 currently, the 24,800-acre site is a patch of empty land in the desert. Grady Gammage, a spokesperson for the Belmont Partners, argues that this fact gives the company a unique advantage: \xe2\x80\x9cEnvisioning future infrastructure from scratch is far easier and more cost efficient than retrofitting an existing urban fabric.\xe2\x80\x9d Eventually, the city (currently called Belmont) will boast 80,000 homes, 3,800 acres of industrial, office, and retail space, and 470 acres for public schools.3. Dubai's 'Smart Dubai 2021' PlanOver the next decade, Dubai will look more and more like it came from a sci-fi movie.The city has laid out 2021 goals that include: - 3D-printing 25% of the city\xe2\x80\x99s buildings- Making 25% of transportation trips automated and driverless- Installing hundreds of artificial trees that use solar power to provide the city with free Wi-Fi, screens with mapping information, and ports for charging phones- Integrating passenger drones that can carry individuals into their public transportation system- Becoming one of the top 10 sustainable cities by 2020- Becoming the happiest city on Earth With this top-down approach, Dubai is setting a prime example for other governments around the world to follow. As other nations see Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s tourism and efficiency exponentially increase, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that other cities will follow suit.\xc2\xa0And, as cities begin to intelligently incorporate big data into their infrastructure, they will become more efficient, sustainable and prosperous.4. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Neom Project Saudi Arabia is also redesigning the ideal future city with NEOM, a $500 billion independent economic zone currently under construction in a 26,500 sq. km. area in Tabuk. This tech utopia, part of the Saudi Vision 2030 plan, will be powered solely by sustainable energy. Economic incentives in nine sectors aim to reduce regional dependence on oil, while an open source approach invites global data scientists and entrepreneurs to catalyze urban innovation. Other goals in the NEOM road map:- Automate and democratize access to government services- Free highest-speed Internet and free online continuous education for residents- Net-zero carbon footprint on all buildings- A transportation system built in anticipation of future mobility platforms, with a layout equally suitable for pedestrians, cyclists and commutersSaudi Arabia is already demonstrating how legacy regulations and linear systems must adapt to our exponential future. In November 2017, Saudi Arabia granted the first citizenship to Sophia, a humanoid robot by Hanson Robotics. In June 2018, many Saudi women drove for the first time, as a decades-old ban was lifted by royal decree. How will futuristic, open source, utopian cities like NEOM and Dubai interface with linear, slow-moving governments? How will the rise of such global innovation hotbeds rebalance economic activity and investments?Implications and big questionsThe implications of exponential technology on cities are vast. In our lifetimes, we will see exciting developments that blur the lines between science fiction and reality. If I was starting a city from scratch, here are the questions I would ask and think about. What about you?- Would you begin with a Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP) for the city?- Would you incorporate a city-wide Token/Coin and do an ICO for city services?- Would you make human driven cars illegal?- Would all-autonomous cars allow the elimination of all parking lots, parking garages and street parking?- Do you need traffic lights?- Would you make the city and all transportation 100% renewable electric, with maximum solar penetration?- Would you put a Hyperloop station at the center of the city plan?- How would you leverage AR & VR for creating citizen avatars that potentially disrupt transportation even further?- Would you require vertical farming to generate 50% of the food supply?- Would you offer wireless gigabit services for free within the city footprint?- How would you enable movement of human capital to encourage innovation?- How would you deliver education? (Wait for my next article for my thoughts on this.) We must ask all these questions as we adapt to large and fast-growing city populations.Some cities, like the ones I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned above, have a head start on this with their proxy MTP announcements. Will they attract better talent, or dominate future trade? How will these implications change the geopolitics in an oil-based region like the Middle East? To me, one thing is crystal clear: the future of cities is an exciting place for innovation and disruption.This is the first in a four-part series by Peter H.

In 1968, man was yet to walk on the moon, computers were enormous, and the plastics industry was about to boom. For a family business in Syracuse, NY, 1968 would mark the beginning of legacy as a leading manufacturing supplier to some of the biggest companies in the world.\nFounded by John and Betty Armstrong, who came to the U.S. from Coventry, UK, where John started out as a Wood and Metal Pattern Maker apprentice, Armstrong RM began with modest dreams of building a small firm of five. Today, as the company celebrates its 50th anniversary, Armstrong employs over 150 people, headed up by the family\xe2\x80\x99s next generation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was 9-years-old and with my dad at the plant when the first equipment was delivered,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Armstrong, President of Armstrong RM recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a clue what it was. Today, decades later, I still see some of that original equipment as I walk around our plant.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen Armstrong started out, the company intended to make cast moulds for plastic moulding, but soon got into the RIM (Reaction Injection Moulding) process when a customer problem turned into an opportunity. A clothing designer came to Armstrong to produce a mannequin mould but soon struggled to find anyone to run the body forms. A short conversation with a local material supplier later and a 50-piece order for RIM polyurethane was made.\nAfter a few successful years, it was decided that getting into the casting business, where John had started off at Sims Castings in the early 60s, would be the way to go when a sales rep showed up at the Armstrong home in Minoa with 37 aluminium casting jobs to quote for technology giant, IBM. The team can still remember the meeting in the Armstrong family living room going on until the early hours when what was thought to be an initial order for a handful of the most suitable parts ended with IBM ordering quantities of all 37.\n\xc3\x97\nExpand\nArmstrong production facility.\nDuring the 1970s, the company expanded, leasing a new facility and ramping its team up to around 75 employees. Throughout the next decade, rapid growth continued as Armstrong became a primary supplier to companies at the beginning of the telecomm technology explosion. Additional locations were sought, and a machine shop was added.\nArmstrong currently boasts a state-of-the-art 100,000 square ft. manufacturing facility featuring numerous casting, moulding, machining and rapid prototyping processes for prototypes and low volume metal or plastic production, along with a recently acquired space in Hingham, MA. TCT paid a visit to the new office last year where examples of handcrafted wooden models and plastic prototypes provided a clear view of how the company has evolved over the years.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe try to utilise any technology that helps us fulfil our mission,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Armstrong, Director of Marketing told TCT. \xe2\x80\x9cWe find that many time-tested older methods like casting aluminium can provide the best path to manufacture a part especially if taking advantage of more 21st century technology in the process such as AM models, CMM inspection or CNC Machining. We like to think of ourselves as a fine blend of the 14th and 21st Centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\nArmstrong has always been about embracing old school craftsmanship with modern technologies. In 1994, the company was the first manufacturer in New York State to purchase and utilise a 3D Systems stereolithography machine. Being an early adopter meant Armstrong spent much of the decade focussing on its rapid prototyping business, creating models for manufacturing cast injection moulds in a variety of consumer related applications from Black and Decker to Whirlpool, and McDonalds.\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstalling 3D Systems equipment was significant as it was new, exciting technology that our customers were just learning about,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt positioned us as an early technology leader, pulled in a lot of customer interest and was a significant advancement to improve our services and reduce lead times.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc3\x97\nExpand\nArmstrong was an early adopter of SLA technology.\nNowadays you would be hard pressed to find an area within which Armstrong hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made some form of model or part, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in space on the NASA shuttle; protecting the homeland under oceans on submarines; or cast hubcaps for President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural limo.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver the years, we have made so many interesting parts for the cutting-edge technology of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul added. \xe2\x80\x9cMost recently we have been working with Rethink Robotics of Boston in developing and launching the Sawyer robot, we worked with Civiq Cityscapes on the Link NYC kiosks all over greater New York City. My favourite part we made in the early days was a cast aluminium guitar body for a local guitar maker named Jim Brunet. He gave one of his first guitars to Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones who used it that night at their concert at the Carrier Dome in front of 50,000 fans.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy the end of the 90s, Armstrong had grown to 240 employees with sales over 20 million USD but technological shifts and major events in U.S. history, meant that by the early 2000s, the industry landscape looked very different. As Armstrong describes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe honeymoon in manufacturing was over.\xe2\x80\x9d But the lean period - \xe2\x80\x9clean\xe2\x80\x9d still meaning 150 employees - was by no means the end and as the country started to get its mojo back, so did Armstrong. The company carved itself a reputation within a highly competitive, technology driven market, which saw huge orders from those initial blue-chip customers like IBM. By 2008, Armstrong reached a high-water mark with sales close to 30 million USD.\n\xc3\x97\nExpand\nHandcrafted wooden pattern.\nToday, customers include the likes of Uber, Rethink Robotics, Medtronic and Boeing, still comprising that old school mentality with modern solutions whether making one or 1,000 parts. The company has grown from a \xe2\x80\x9cmom and pop\xe2\x80\x9d shop into a modern manufacturing facility, but there are still new challenges, particularly in exciting the next generation to get involved in manufacturing and engineering.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkilled labour is much scarcer as manufacturing has been perceived as a declining career path when in fact with the advent of all the new advanced manufacturing technologies the high skilled opportunities are endless,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul commented.\nArmstrong\xe2\x80\x99s motto is, \xe2\x80\x9ca strong future stands behind us.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s a history of experience, knowledge and of course, mistakes made, but Armstrong is by no means resting on its laurels. It can\xe2\x80\x99t, the manufacturing industry is constantly changing and in the current age of automation and new processes coming in at a rapid rate, the team is not afraid of getting stuck into the latest technology or opportunity.\nPaul concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cAll of that drives us forward, to keep providing high quality castings and moulded plastics parts as we head into our next 50 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTags\n3D Printing\nAdditive Manufacturing\nArmstrong Mold\n3D Printing News\nby\nLaura Griffiths\n23 July 2018\n14:35\nLatest\nView more\nAccept Cookies?YesWaitLeave\nNews\nImaging\nSoftware\nServices\nEvents\nTCT Show\nTCT Awards\nTCT Asia\nRAPID + TCT\nTCT Conference @ Formnext\nBlogs\nDaniel O\'Connor\'s Blog\nLaura Griffiths\' Blog\nSam Davies\' Blog\nThe Todd Grimm Column\nJim Woodcock\'s Blog\nDuncan Wood\'s Blog\nGuest Blogs\nAwards\nTCT Hall of Fame\nWebinars\nDirectory\nSubscribe\nMag\nAbout Us\nAdvertise with TCT\nContact Us\nPartners\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Rapid News Publications Ltd.

(Photo of Hong Kong via Pixabay)\nLinkedinTwitterFacebookSubscribeMail\nThe street light may not look like technology. But many technologists believe the humble street light will illuminate the future of smart cities.\nThese new smart street lights come equipped with energy-efficient LED bulbs, which last longer and use less power than traditional street lights. But there\xe2\x80\x99s more: these light poles can also include built-in wireless connectivity (Bluetooth and wifi), high-definition digital cameras, and sensors to monitor weather and air quality. Most smart street lights come with a control network that can connect a city-wide array of sensors, and analytics packages.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real killer app for smart cities is smart street lighting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sean Tippett, the Director of Smart Cities and IoT at Silver Spring Networks, which specializes in Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for business. \xe2\x80\x9cIt pays for itself, and then you have an IoT network in place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSmart street lights are the leading edge of an ambitious vision for smart cities, with the IoT bringing intelligence to everything from trash cans to park benches to dedicated ad-supported wifi kiosks like the LinkNYC or CIVIQ SmartScapes. The goal is to allow cities to use sensors and data analysis to bring intelligence to urban environments, and improve the quality of life for residents.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA smart city harnesses the power of its data to run more efficiently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melvin Greer, Chief Data Scientist at Intel Corp. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery company and every city is now data-centric.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that will arrive slowly, and in phases. The first phase involves deploying networks of sensors to collect data.\nThe trajectory of smart cities has been further transformed by the rise of autonomous vehicles, which have the potential to bring transformational changes in how cities are designed and function. Futurists and smart cities advocates foresee a future in which self-driving cars communicate with one another and the infrastructure around them. Imagine an urban landscape in which cars communicate with streetlights to improve traffic flow, and use sensors to locate empty parking spaces \xe2\x80\x93 and naturally, park themselves.\nThe realization of data flowing from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) could be decades away. But it underscores the disruptive potential of combining the Internet of Things and autonomous cars.\nA New Role for Data Centers\nSmart cities are a key component of our digital future, bringing together the Internet of Things, BigData, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars to change the way we live and do business in major urban centers.\nData centers will be major beneficiaries of the emergence of smart cities, which will require lots of connectivity, data storage and compute power for analytics to crunch all that data. How big is this opportunity, and when will it arrive?\nFree Resource from Data Center Frontier White Paper Library\nSlow Provisioning Derails IT Transformation Efforts\nIn this report, 451 Research analyst Christian Perry underscores the negative impact slow provisioning can have on your IT transformation efforts using results from their recent Voice of the Enterprise survey of over 500 enterprises. Download the new white paper from Cyxtera that contends it's time for groundbreaking innovation in data center colocation that overcomes slow provisioning.\nDownload\nTo answer these questions, Data Center Frontier has spent the past 18\xc2\xa0 months speaking with leading technologists, vendors and public officials to understand how the evolution of smart cities may change the data center landscape. We\xe2\x80\x99ve attended conferences like the Industry of Things World and Internet of Things World, along with data center industry events.\nThe bottom line: True smart cities will arrive slowly, and face challenges in gaining funding and political support. But early adopters are already deploying networks of sensors and devices to lay the groundwork for more ambitious smart infrastructure ahead.\n\xe2\x80\x9cData centers that support smart cities can\xe2\x80\x99t be designed on power and real estate concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Intel\xe2\x80\x99s Greer. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be designed in a much smaller footprint and focused on a much more concentrated series of concerns. In the smart cities of the future, the data will be more important than the center.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBeyond the Hype: Making Smart Cities Real\nThe smart city is an urban development that integrates information technology and the Internet of things (IoT) into the fabric of city life, using analytics and sensors to better manage cities and make urban ife safer, more efficient and sustainable. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one more expression of how next-generation technologies are remaking the American landscape.\nAs with most new technologies, the smart cities movement has generated excitement about the possibilities.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople want their pizza delivered in two minutes, by a drone\xe2\x80\x9d said Lou Lutostanski, Vice President for Internet of Things at Avnet. \xe2\x80\x9cTechnology is no longer a limiter. Our imagination is the only limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC kiosks are deployed at 7,500 locations across Manhattan, replacing payphones with ad-supported wifi and services. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to imagine technology than build it and pay for it. So it will be with smart cities, which will emerge gradually.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re at approximately the peak of the hype cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharelynn Moore, VP of Global Marketing at Itron, a leading vendor in the IoT and smart cities sector. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is real business to be had here. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of really amazing things coming. The cost and power of the technology has come down enough to make it work.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you get the infrastructure overlay, these applications will appear,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are on-ramps that can get you started. But we are just getting started on innovation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSilver Spring\xe2\x80\x99s Tippett says smart city strategies will serve as an economic development tool.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe see very progressive, forward-looking cities seeing this as an innovation point and a differentiator, using early investments to attract developers and businesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tippett.\nLeading With Lighting\nA lot of those early investments are in smart lighting projects, which can piggyback on a larger trend to convert legacy streetlights to LED to reduce energy costs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do a lot of work in the connected lighting sector, and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it continue to grow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tippett, who sees an opportunity in providing monitoring and management to cities, which often don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it themselves. As connected things proliferate, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a small job.\nEarly projects have been promising. In 2014, San Diego installed a network of 3,000 smart streetlights from GE, which is now saving the city about $250,000 annually in electricity and maintenance costs (since outages are reported electronically, allowing targeted truck rolls for repairs during daylight hours).\nOther cities are beginning to install these systems at scale. Officials in Edinburgh, Scotland are deploying a network of 64,000 smart street lights from Telensa, complete with wireless nodes to provide wifi for residents.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all of our vision for the IoT comes to pass, there will be a lot of devices out there, and scalability becomes important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tippett. \xe2\x80\x9cThere needs to be a very strong emphasis on security. The technology provider has a responsibility to ensure that the solution is secure and can scale.\xe2\x80\x9d\nClearing the Confusion on the Tech & the Opportunity\nThe expo hall at Internet of Things World stretches across much of the Santa Clara Convention Center. As you walk past booth after booth of connected things, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dazzling array of IoT tech. Some of it is super cool, while some leaves you scratching your head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to grapple with all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jon Walton, CIO of San Mateo County. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much of the stuff we see on the expo floor is so new. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s really going to be around. The IoT is actually far ahead of where government wants to engage.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKitra RushUp is an Internet of Things platform based on Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s ARTIK technology that uses sensors to manage lighting and security and provide data on weather and environmental emissions, as seen in this demo overlay of data collection in San Francisco. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nOn a panel of municipal officials, Walton said that learning curve is a challenge for cities seeking to evangelize a smart cities strategy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need executive sponsorship and strong leaders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to make IoT tangible. IT in government has always been seen as an expense. The conversation we\xe2\x80\x99re having now is \xe2\x80\x98are some of these a service?\xe2\x80\x99 If we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to try to monetize IoT, maybe we focus on providing a benefit, rather than advertising or business models.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWalton and San Mateo County have developed a \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Region Model\xe2\x80\x9d to focus on agencies working together to use shared technology resources to solve regional problems. The concept brings together\xc2\xa0smart parking solutions, smart street lights, waste management, energy management and asset tracking.\nFinding the Funding, and the Business Model\nIn an era of tight budgets for cities and counties, a key question is how governments will fund their investment in smart city initiatives.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the ROI (return on investment) on public wifi versus affordable housing?\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said. The key selling point will initially be financial efficiency \xe2\x80\x93 finding better and cheaper ways to provide services. Some IOT-driven services may provide opportunities for monetization through public-private partnerships (PPPs) that offer a public benefit while providing a financial incentive for the business partner.\nOne option is creating wired innovation districts that can attract startups and other connected businesses. Many early monetization strategies focus on the sale or exchange of data gathered through sensor networks, which raises privacy questions.\nDavid Tolson of DBT-DATA.\nDave Tolson of DBT Data has a unique perspective on the smart cities discussion. For many years, Tolson built upscale housing in urban markets, before shifting his focus to data center development. Building truly smart cities will require serious investment in infrastructure, Tolson said, which is not an area where government has a strong track record \xe2\x80\x93 with the exception of cities preparing for the Olympics or Super Bowls.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the federal, state and local level, there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough money to update infrastructure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tolson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe return would be phenomenal. It\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent and profitable to do. But where is the money going to come from? It can\xe2\x80\x99t come completely from the private sector.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a little skeptical,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe opportunity is currently very limited.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Evolving Role of the Data Center\nWhat does this mean for data center economics? A number of developers and service providers are positioning themselves to benefit from demand for urban IT infrastructure. Smart cities are a particular flavor of edge computing, with the accompanying focus on right sizing the data center form factor.\nWhen it comes to data center infrastructure, smart cities will mix the old and the new, creating opportunities for traditional \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d connectivity hubs as well as smaller data centers\xc2\xa0 optimized for edge computing.\nMulti-tenant carrier hotels\xc2\xa0have been\xc2\xa0cornerstones of the Internet economy since the 1990s, and are some of the most successful properties in the colocation industry. Typically located in the central business district of major cities, buildings like One Wilshire (LA) and 60 Hudson Street (New York) and the Dallas Infomart, these buildings house meet-me rooms, a common area where providers can make physical connections between their networks.\nExecutives at Netrality, which owns carrier hotels in five U.S. markets, say its facilities are positioned to benefit as smart city technologies are deployed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these applications are highly-dependent on low-latency connectivity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gerald Marshall, President and CEO of Netrality. We\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see the infrastructure to support these initiatives in our properties.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA Hangar drone hovering in front of the Vapor Edge Module. (Image: Hangar)\nAt the other end of the spectrum are micro data centers that will help deploy infrastructure for 5G wireless connectivity\xc2\xa0and low-latency applications.\nEdge computing specialist Vapor IO\xc2\xa0has begun deploying unmanned \xe2\x80\x9clights-out\xe2\x80\x9d data center modules\xc2\xa0 in downtown Chicago, including a test site that serves as a launchpad for drone startup Hangar.\xc2\xa0 In an early example of infrastructure for a robot-powered smart city, the two companies are creating an edge computing network to manage drones as they fly missions to collect and analyze oceans of business data.\nThe companies see the collaboration as the first step towards a larger network to manage an automated society.\xc2\xa0Hangar\xe2\x80\x99s real-time tracking system is currently focused on drones, but can also be used to support autonomous cars.\nIntel\xe2\x80\x99s Greer said data center modules are part of an exploding ecosystem of devices and vehicles that will comprise the smart cities to come.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart cities are going to disrupt this idea of the huge, monolithic data center,\xe2\x80\x9d said Greer. \xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The iPhone X isn\xe2\x80\x99t a smartphone. It\xe2\x80\x99s an artificial intelligence device. The (car) key is a sensor. It knows when you are in proximity to your vehicle.

Got skills? Why pwn the noobs from your couch when you could do it in front of an audience of hundreds at New York\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever Fortnite In The Heights Tournament?\nComing on Saturday, Aug. 11 to the Armory New Balance Track & Field Center in Washington Heights, Fortnite In The Heights invites all gamers to bring their iOS device or Nintendo Switch to battle it out for a prize pool of $10,000. Tickets are $15, and anyone can sign up to play (limited only by the Armory\xe2\x80\x99s capacity).\nOrganized by Silicon Harlem, The Armory Foundation, iHeartRadio and LinkNYC, the tournament will be livestreamed on The Armory\xe2\x80\x99s Jumbotron and on Twitch. Doors open at 11 a.m., which also starts the clock on the two-hour preliminary round of games to qualify for the tournament. The top 400 players will move forward, with the winner decided at 5 p.m.\nRecommended Slideshows\n40 PicturesPHOTOS: Blues dump Bruins to win Stanley Cup after agonizing 52-year wait40 Pictures\n8 PicturesPHOTOS: This Pakistani waiter looks just like Peter Dinklage8 Pictures\n36 PicturesAll of these celebrities have had their nudes leaked36 PicturesMore picture galleries\n16 PicturesThese photos of Trump and Ivanka will make you deeply uncomfortable\n16 Pictures\n4 PicturesCuba Gooding Jr. charged in Manhattan groping incident, police say4 Pictures\n2 Pictures4 fun things to do in the Lehigh Valley2 Pictures\nThere is no age limit to participate, but players younger than 18 must have a parent or guardian accompany them or a permission slip allowing them to play. Spectator tickets are $15; a DJ and emcee will provide entertainment, and \xe2\x80\x9chealthy snacks\xe2\x80\x9d will be available for purchase.\nEpic Games\xe2\x80\x99 free-to-play video game Fortnite has become a global sensation, making $223 million in March alone. The premise of the game is simple: 100 players are dropped on an island and must fight to be the last man (or woman, but mostly teenage boy) standing.\nThe idea behind the event is at least in part to encourage taking part in what can legitimately be called sports here in the real world (which is reeling a bit because of Fortnite, ironically). Fortnite In The Heights is a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity-driven, family-friendly event, is designed to combine gaming, technology, and fitness for all,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the organizers. Early arrivals can even opt to run a few laps around the Armory track.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith more than 180,000 athlete visits each year to The Armory, many of whom are also eSports players, this will be a social competition for them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Armory Foundation Co-President Jonathan Schindel in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe seating configuration and technology at The Armory are ideal for eSports, and I expect we will also convert some of the gamers into trying out track and field.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLoading...\nLatest From ...\nNews\nShare Now\nShare this

"Quedamos a la espera de la oportunidad de ayudar a m\xc3\xa1s ciudadanos mexicanos en el futuro".

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls\xc2\xa0or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What are the main features the kiosks offer?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How do they improve the lives of residents?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What type of ads do the kiosks display?Fasoldt:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do the kiosks use any analytics?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?Fastold:\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model. In addition to New York, a Link network is live in the U.K.\xc2\xa0We have planned expansions into Philadelphia and Newark, with many more cities on the way.Topics: Kiosk Branding, Kiosk ROI, Kiosks, Kiosks / Self-Service, Technology Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that at any given moment, the majority of the people in your surrounding area are either accessing the web or trying to access the internet with their devices.\nWe live and breathe by our smartphones; they are the gateway to the outside world, the source of our daily communications, and the keys to our personal and financial data. Yet, when we are away from our homes or offices, accessing the web is like pulling teeth. For all the technological advancements we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in 2018, global WiFi is still just a fantasy.\nWhy is global WiFi challenging?\nIt seems like the fix to our WiFi woes should be straightforward\xe2\x80\x93but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. The lack of wifi is only going to grow more inconvenient as the number of smartphone users increases. In fact, by 2019, there will be an estimated 2.5 billion smartphone owners across the globe, and each one of them will depend on their devices to access the web at any given time and location.\nWe take Internet accessibility for granted, but this service is not free. A global, accessible, free (and fast) WiFi system requires service providers to take a financial hit. There is a long history of companies stepping up to provide more accessible WiFi, but these solutions are far from perfect. Consider LinkNYC, a project dedicated to bringing wireless internet access to the city\xe2\x80\x99s residents. Through the installation of thousands of Kiosks across the city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs, LinkNYC saw an opportunity to place free high-speed routers at specific locations to bring the dream of ubiquitous WiFi to fruition.\nAs explored in this 2016 U.S. News coverage of LinkNYC, the \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d description of this project is slightly misleading. Yes, New Yorkers do not have to pay in monetary terms, however, by using routers to access the Internet, they have to provide an email address.\nAt a time when people are more attuned than ever regarding the risk of losing ownership of personal data, the data exchange the LINKNYC model requires does little to build security and privacy confidence in consumers.\nPeer-to-peer exchanges on the blockchain are the future of accessibility.\nUnfortunately, high-speed, secure WiFi cannot exist without the exchange of some form of payment; this payment is usually a financial transaction or personal data. But through building an open network of Wi-Fi hotspots on a blockchain-backed network, people can access the web without having to worry about who is seeing their data or dealing with the frustration of sending payments at every log-in.\nThanks to the rise of the blockchain, there may be another way people can utilize hotspots on-the-go without paying by the minute or relinquishing all of their private data rights.\nSmartphone users are always plugged into the web. Even the most intelligent smartphone user faces daily frustrations in not being able to access sites or apps while on the go. \xc2\xa0Despite being almost permanently online, the majority of smartphone users do not come anywhere close to using up their data allowance for each month. In fact, a survey conducted by OPP Open Wi-Fi found that 68% of participants did not use their entire data allowances each month. This admission indicates that there is wasted data that could be utilized for helping other individuals access the internet free of charge and without the exchange of personal information.\nOPP Open WiFi is one company looking at peer-to-peer data exchanges to solve the issue of WiFi shortages. The organization recognizes that unused data allowance is global and is a significant untapped resource. OPP Open WiFi\xe2\x80\x99s approach relies on a network of WiFi hosts, who, essentially, open the door to their unused data. Through logging onto OPPs application, hosts can turn their devices into hotspots that individuals passing by can utilize in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment.\nOur lives may run on smartphone devices, but WiFi access is the fuel. In addition to merely browsing, more people across the global workforce need unlimited internet access anywhere and at any time; the rise of the freelancer economy has transformed the call to universal WiFi from a wish to a demand.

Tout le monde dit qu\xe2\x80\x99il le fait mais personne ne l\xe2\x80\x99a encore fait.

Cette th\xc3\xa9orie centr\xc3\xa9e sur l\xe2\x80\x99utilisateur, elle l\xe2\x80\x99a apprise \xc3\xa0 la prestigieuse universit\xc3\xa9 am\xc3\xa9ricaine Stanford, o\xc3\xb9 enseigne justement David Kelley, le concepteur de la \xc2\xabpens\xc3\xa9e design\xc2\xbb, en bon fran\xc3\xa7ais.Trouver les besoins, m\xc3\xaame inconscientsPar opposition \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99approche classique qui consiste \xc3\xa0 construire un produit en se concentrant sur la technologie, le faire \xc3\xa9voluer pour essayer de le vendre, \xc2\xabil s\xe2\x80\x99agit pour une entreprise de conna\xc3\xaetre les consommateurs sans savoir vraiment o\xc3\xb9 on va, \xc3\xa9tudier les personnes, conna\xc3\xaetre leurs besoins qui ne sont pas couverts par le march\xc3\xa9 et seulement ensuite cr\xc3\xa9er un nouveau produit pour y r\xc3\xa9pondre\xc2\xbb, illustre celle qui a \xc3\xa9galement pass\xc3\xa9 du temps en immersion dans la Silicon Valley. Bref, \xc2\xabtrouver ce que les consommateurs ne savent pas qu\xe2\x80\x99ils veulent ou ce dont ils ont besoin, mais qu\xe2\x80\x99ils veulent\xc2\xbb.C\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 cas pratiques, son parcours n\xe2\x80\x99en manque pas, entre\xc2\xa0Asie, Europe et Etats-Unis. A Stanford, elle a \xc3\xa9tudi\xc3\xa9 le projet LinkNYC, qui visait \xc3\xa0 remplacer les cabines t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9phoniques par un r\xc3\xa9seau de bornes interactives fournissant un acc\xc3\xa8s gratuit \xc3\xa0 internet. \xc2\xabLes bornes avaient \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 construites, au prix d\xe2\x80\x99un important investissement, mais personne ne les utilisait. Ce produit \xc3\xa9tait remarquable, tr\xc3\xa8s technologique, mais on ne savait pas \xc3\xa0 quoi il servait\xc2\xbb, se souvient Adela Villanueva, qui a phosphor\xc3\xa9 en 2017 avec des \xc3\xa9tudiants pour trouver une utilit\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa0 ces bornes. Une des approches retenues consistait \xc3\xa0 les destiner aux touristes n\xe2\x80\x99ayant pas d\xe2\x80\x99acc\xc3\xa8s \xc3\xa0 internet.C\xe2\x80\x99est d\xe2\x80\x99ailleurs cette exp\xc3\xa9rience am\xc3\xa9ricaine men\xc3\xa9e pro bono, faute d\xe2\x80\x99avoir obtenu un visa, qui l\xe2\x80\x99a indirectement conduite \xc3\xa0 Gen\xc3\xa8ve. Le jour o\xc3\xb9 elle et son mari banquier d\xc3\xa9cident de quitter les Etats-Unis, Adela re\xc3\xa7oit un message du patron de Fusion, Sal Matteis, qui veut la d\xc3\xa9baucher. Les futurs \xc2\xabpartners in crime\xc2\xbb se rencontrent un jeudi et elle commence \xc3\xa0 Fusion le lundi suivant, en juillet 2017.Num\xc3\xa9riser la vie suisseUne autre partie importante de son travail au sein de Fusion consiste \xc3\xa0 trouver des start-up prometteuses et \xc3\xa0 les acc\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9rer, notamment en leur faisant profiter du r\xc3\xa9seau de Fusion. A aider des start-up suisses \xc3\xa0 aller dans le reste du monde et inversement \xc3\xa0 aider des entreprises \xc3\xa9trang\xc3\xa8res \xc3\xa0 s\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tablir en Suisse, par exemple comme porte d\xe2\x80\x99entr\xc3\xa9e sur l\xe2\x80\x99Europe.\xc2\xabLa vie quotidienne est encore peu num\xc3\xa9ris\xc3\xa9e en Suisse, beaucoup de choses doivent encore \xc3\xaatre faites sous forme papier, donc le pays offre beaucoup d\xe2\x80\x99opportunit\xc3\xa9s, analyse-t-elle. Mais quand on parle de la Suisse avec des start-up \xc3\xa9trang\xc3\xa8res, leur premi\xc3\xa8re r\xc3\xa9ponse concerne le co\xc3\xbbt de la vie ici. Elles savent aussi qu\xe2\x80\x99il y a beaucoup d\xe2\x80\x99innovation et de capital disponible en Suisse, c\xe2\x80\x99est un atout, m\xc3\xaame s\xe2\x80\x99il faudrait davantage de capital-risque. Et il faudrait aussi faire davantage pour aider des entrepreneurs \xc3\xa9trangers \xc3\xa0 s\xe2\x80\x99implanter ici.\xc2\xbbLire aussi: Une bourse des valeurs num\xc3\xa9riques est lanc\xc3\xa9e \xc3\xa0 Gen\xc3\xa8veLorsqu\xe2\x80\x99on mentionne les diff\xc3\xa9rents projets genevois li\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 la blockchain, parfois sous l\xe2\x80\x99impulsion des autorit\xc3\xa9s, elle r\xc3\xa9pond sous l\xe2\x80\x99angle de l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat d\xe2\x80\x99esprit: \xc2\xabLa Suisse doit passer de l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tape \xc2\xabje veux faire\xc2\xbb \xc3\xa0 \xc2\xabje fais\xc2\xbb, on arr\xc3\xaate de parler et on fait, que ce soit pour la blockchain, l\xe2\x80\x99IoT ou l\xe2\x80\x99int\xc3\xa9gration de start-up \xc3\xa9trang\xc3\xa8res\xc2\xbb.

Repito la operaci\xc3\xb3n en el resto de Kennedy, y el panorama es el mismo: cabinas abandonadas a su suerte, llenas de grafitis, avisos publicitarios, teclas hundidas, pantallas rotas.

Sin embargo, la irrupci\xc3\xb3n de las nuevas tecnolog\xc3\xadas ha hecho evidente una ca\xc3\xadda significativa en su uso\xe2\x80\x9d, dice un portavoz de la empresa.\nLas cabinas son ahora parte del mobiliario de vendedores informales.\nFoto:\nAna Puentes\nAvanzo por la cuadra del Hospital de Kennedy; ninguno de los tres tel\xc3\xa9fonos p\xc3\xbablicos sirve.

Las filas eran largas para hacer una llamada por 2 o 5 centavos: la conexi\xc3\xb3n ahora era posible en barrios vulnerables.\nLas primeras cabinas eran tipo burbuja.\nFoto:\nLIBRO \xe2\x80\x98ETB. 131 A\xc3\x91OS CONECTANDO VIDAS\xe2\x80\x99\nA principios de los 90 se pens\xc3\xb3 en innovaci\xc3\xb3n. Se instalaron sistemas para pago con tarjeta de cr\xc3\xa9dito y se implementaron llamadas gratis a cambio de escuchar ocho segundos de propaganda. Comenzaba la decadencia.Y lo cierto es que esto coincidi\xc3\xb3 con el vandalismo, que siempre le encontr\xc3\xb3 el quiebre al sistema. Cuando eran tipo monedero, romp\xc3\xadan la caja para robar el producido. Cuando el pago fue por tarjeta, introdujeron objetos por las ranuras y los inutilizaron. Adem\xc3\xa1s, les quitaron las bocinas, se llevaron los cables, abollaron las bases de metal. Y cuando de ellos qued\xc3\xb3 solo el esqueleto, los llenaron de grafitis, les pegaron publicidad, los volvieron puntos de basura y dejaron que los perros orinaran sobre ellos.A inicios de este siglo, la crisis era latente. Aunque se hab\xc3\xada habilitado una tarjeta prepago para promover su uso, los vendedores de minutos les ganaron terreno.En 2014, en un intento por renovar las estructuras se hizo un plan piloto en 40 cabinas para ofrecer internet wifi gratis: permitir\xc3\xada la conexi\xc3\xb3n simult\xc3\xa1nea de 20 personas con una velocidad de un mega. En su momento se dijo que para 2016 habr\xc3\xada 6.000 nodos como estos. Hoy, el proyecto est\xc3\xa1 detenido.

Mike Tyquin on the sector\xe2\x80\x99s future.\nThis article was sponsored by Adshel to let readers know about the future of digital out-of-home\xc2\xa0\xc2\xbb\nOut-of-home (OOH), like other media, is transforming in response to digitisation, data and the changing expectations of advertisers. Digital screens supported by ad servers that update content in response to real-time triggers are already here. Innovative campaigns, too, are also already using rudimentary face recognition, QR codes and image scanning, beacons and citizen wayfinding.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of evidence of forward thinking happening in out-of-home (OOH). But what about the future?\nTen years from now, which trends may have the biggest impact on how marketers use OOH? It\xe2\x80\x99s likely to go beyond digital screens, flexible trading, and better verification and reporting. The trends that will play out in the next decade will make the most of internet connectivity, data and mobile communications capabilities.\nOutdoor won\xe2\x80\x99t evolve in isolation, it will respond to the same trends in the advertising, social media, mobile technology and content consumption that impact the whole media sector. What is unique to the future of this medium though is its audience growth.\nUnlike other media, recent digitisation has not resulted in audience fragmentation; in fact, increasing urbanisation means more people are out and about consuming content. The challenges facing outdoor will instead focus on the management of digital technology, new business models, and educating brands and agencies about the creative possibilities.\nNo matter what form outdoor media\xe2\x80\x99s future takes, data is going to be a big part of it. Both the scale of data and how useful it is will take centre stage.\nA key, and somewhat unanswered, question is: what are we going to use data for?\nWill it be more suited to insight led solutions, or precision targeting? Ideally, if the data is good enough and big enough it should be able to do both. Good quality data will enable marketers to specifically target audiences. The data feedback loop will increase measurability, making OOH campaigns more powerful than ever before, generating better reports and more meaningful analytics. Today, location profiling is used to build target audiences based on postcodes and suburbs.\nIn the future, as capability increases to collect and process offline and online audience information, data will become richer, higher quality and more scalable. That means marketers will no longer be targeting audiences via the area where they are located, but instead will be targeting audiences on their behaviour. For example, putting a geofence around a supermarket\xe2\x80\x99s customer footprint and then identifying devices that visit that supermarket more than three times a week enables marketers to build a custom audience of regular grocery shoppers.\nThis evolution from location profiling to building custom audiences means better targeting and more effective marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just campaign and audience data sources to consider. The addition of data from mobiles, smartwatches and other wearables will change the way OOH is targeted and deployed to create contextually relevant ads. Interactive experiences and instantaneous delivery will increasingly feature in OOH. Retargeting will become a possibility with ads seemingly following you as you move around.\nAn ad on a train will pop up on the street as you exit the station, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it again on a digital screen at your favourite caf\xc3\xa9 and it will seem to travel with you as you move around the shopping centre. OgilvyOne\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 Battersea Dogs Home campaign is an early example of how radio frequency ID can be used to have ads \xe2\x80\x98follow\xe2\x80\x99 people. Like the Battersea Dogs Home campaign shows, as creatives develop their approach to the future possibilities of digital OOH, they will adjust the broadcast messaging so it connects with audiences in specific locations \xe2\x80\x93 and do so at scale.\nA media buy of 2000 panels could potentially deliver 2000 contextually relevant messages. The rollout of innovations like these will challenge the way creatives build campaigns. Technology-enabled screens able to intelligently deliver relevant messages \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0by recognising a single consumer, knowing how many people are standing in front of it, what time of day it is and what the weather is like \xe2\x80\x93 are likely to become widespread in high-frequency areas.\nPersonalised posters featured in the sci-fi film Minority Report set in 2054, but posters with advertising pitched at an individual are almost with us now.\nFor instance, IBM has publicised development work on its facial recognition systems. NEC has run trials in Japan using posters that can calculate the gender and age of an individual. Pedestrians don\xe2\x80\x99t have to stop and look at the screen; they only need to pass by to be recognised, so smart posters will be ideal executions for heavy foot traffic areas. Technology-enabled screens will also have the potential to cultivate a second sector for OOH advertising.\nOut-of-home will continue to deliver broadcast advertising and brand building; it may also develop a parallel capability that moves beyond targeting to personalisation \xe2\x80\x93 advertising delivered for a specific individual. The rollout of tech-supported digital screens will be expensive to build and install. They will only become commonplace if the development of technology aligns with consumer privacy and individual data protection trends.\nBrands will need to unambiguously communicate to consumers their ability to control and opt-out of personalised advertising. The high penetration of smart devices, and increased phone functionality, combined with improved outdoor data supply, are key trends that will influence how out-of-home connects with audiences on the move. Tech supported screens like the ones described above also open up the possibilities of interactive out-of-home (IOOH) \xe2\x80\x93 advertising that can jump off the screen to a mobile, continuing the conversation. Interactivity between digital screens and smart devices may well prove to be one of the biggest opportunities for OOH in the coming years because of how impactful it will be.\nAt the moment there is no technology that can unlock mass market interactivity between smartphones and posters, so it is less developed than facial recognition. Questions are yet to be answered about where and when consumers will be willing to interact with posters, and whether that be passive (perhaps by receiving mobile content simply by walking past a poster) or whether interaction will work only when a decision to download is made.\nThe expenditure required to make this sort of tech widespread will be influenced by identifying locations with significant dwell time and engagement. Bus shelters, train stations and shopping areas have higher dwell-times, while some retail and airports have greater engagement levels.\nThe other factor that needs to be solved is the speed at which an outdoor device can connect with a smart device.\nTo be effective, connection will need to happen instantaneously. Delivering data as consumers pass a screen is more viable in low-dwell time locations. Interaction that requires stopping or a more time-consuming action like touching a device to a screen will only make sense in high engagement locations.\nOutdoor media will increasingly work with councils to play a role in delivering smart cities. A smart city integrates technology into the lives of residents to make them safer, more efficient and easier. The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect OOH screens with mobile phones and buses and trains. Conceivably, you could be notified by your phone that your bus is running late and it could then suggest nearby caf\xc3\xa9s to visit while you wait or, if it\xe2\x80\x99s raining, suggest a walking route to your destination with the most shelter.\nOutdoor screens and street furniture will be connected to a city\xe2\x80\x99s lighting grid. City infrastructure will recognise patterns of low pedestrian traffic and send a signal to street lights, wayfinding and ad screens to turn off when they\xe2\x80\x99re not needed.\nIn New York City, LinkNYC has delivered public Wi-Fi hubs that combine digital ad screens with superfast Wi-Fi, charging ports and a tablet giving access to local maps and other points of interest. In Paris, 100 of the city\xe2\x80\x99s iconic newspaper kiosks will be upgraded next year with OOH touch screens, offering digital self-service, event ticket sales and device-charging.\nOnly in its infancy, wayfinding and other citizen services will grow to better integrate OOH advertising assets with useful functionality for residents. It is this theme of connectivity that best captures the direction of OOH in the next 10 years. Out-of-home will be better integrated, with the internet, mobile devices and city infrastructure. And it won\xe2\x80\x99t just be about pushing out messages; it will be about meaningful enhancement of audiences\xe2\x80\x99 lives as advertisers connect to audiences.\nMike Tyquin is Adshel CEO.\nAdshel is now trading ads by time, day and location.

Media owners have begun to make city-wide audiences available and more addressable using smart city technology in less intrusive ways than the retina scanning technology that served up personalized ads in sci-fi thriller Minority Report.\nFor instance, sensor technology built into digital posters is used to more accurately estimate the number of shoppers in the vicinity at a given time of day, while traffic monitoring provides insight into traffic patterns that can be used to adjust playback duration on billboard content.\nTaking cues from the ad industry, urban planners are exploring how similar data and technology can be implemented to improve urban life. Across the globe, cities are getting smarter. A recent report projects the smart cities industry to exceed $1.2 billion by 2022, a figure that will continue to trend upward as new advances in big data, AI, IoT, 5G and sensor arrays make smart cities more viable. But what makes a city intelligent, and what role will advertising play in the continued smart city evolution? How will smart cities change the way brands communicate with audiences?\nA smart city uses real-time data and technology to improve the urban experience while keeping the populace informed via channels such as road signage, shopping kiosks, connected vehicles, and mobile devices. New York City, London, Philadelphia and Newark have already begun implementing smart city elements.\nIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s interactive Link kiosks (below), spread throughout city sidewalks, provide residents and travelers with free Wi-Fi, access to municipal services, transit routes, directions and more. Another great example is JCDecaux\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable smart bus shelters in Paris, which provide real-time traffic information and USB charging ports.\nA key function of any smart city is informing the public, which requires a means to communicate everything from AMBER Alerts to natural disaster warnings and transit outages/updates. Digital out-of-home displays typically used for advertising, along with mobile devices, are quickly becoming the conduit through which smart cities communicate these messages to the public. In the near future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll likely see the number of \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d kiosks grow, as well as more traditional outdoor displays and street furniture become digitized.\nBuilding, powering and maintaining these communication outposts, however, requires extensive financial backing, and cities are beginning to explore various means to fund these projects. To date, public-private partnerships have proven one of the more favorable options. A number of private sector businesses have been working with local governments to provide resources for communicating with citizens, such as Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC kiosks or Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 investment in the Sidewalk Toronto project.\nFor private companies to sustain these projects, monetization is key, and advertising is proving a viable revenue stream. LinkNYC is funded in part by ad revenue and on track to generate more than $500 million for the city over the course of 12 years, and Kansas City, MO has already started to see ad revenue roll in from 25 smart kiosks backed by Cisco and Sprint. As a result, the audience that advertisers want to reach will likely play a key role in determining the location of displays and sensor technology.\nSmart cities arrive at a prime time for the ad industry, in an age of ad blockers and DVR, and one where consumers are increasingly fatigued by what they deem an onslaught of irrelevant mobile and online ads. They open up potential for brands and advertisers to rethink how they connect with consumers, and more accurately target the right audiences at the right time with meaningful content that proves useful to locals and travelers as they navigate their days.\nUsing geolocation, traffic and Wi-Fi data from smart city technology, brands can deliver more personalized, omni-channel campaigns with location-based messaging \xe2\x80\x93 whether on a mobile device, nearby digital billboard or kiosk, a connected car, or a combination thereof. For instance, a passenger stepping off a city bus around lunch time might interact with an ad that provides discount for a local restaurant a few blocks away as they check the transit schedule.\nSmart cities are a win-win for advertisers and the public. By enabling the development and delivery of more targeted, relevant messages, they allow brands to leave a lasting impression with audiences, which could result in greater brand loyalty and influence buying behaviors. At the same time, local residents and travelers benefit from advertisements that cater more specifically to their needs and interests, as well as the information that ad-funded smart city technology provides.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that cities around the world are rapidly embracing smart technology to improve urban life. At the simplest level, today I can pay for parking without any change or a meter in most cities, and in others I can find a free parking spot on an app and reserve it. Factor in self-driving cars, and eventually we\xe2\x80\x99ll have our own personal valets. Smart cities are quickly simplifying our day-to-day, and once commonplace, the old way of doing things will seem as foreign as using a paper map today versus a GPS.\nAs they continue to evolve, advertising will be a key piece of the puzzle, as both a monetization source and influence on the messages we see every day on the street, in transit, via the internet and on our mobile devices. The data that smart cities generate, handled responsibly, introduces a host of new opportunities for advertisers to measure and reach audiences in new ways, giving the industry a chance to reshape consumer perception of and interaction with advertising overall.\nJody Smith is product manager at global digital signage provider Broadsign.\nYou May Also Like\nPaul Simons: the ad that restored my faith in advertising\nHow Smartology connects news brands with top advertisers\nTech company ITG buys Connect marketing agency\nNow MediaMonk Sorrell sets his sights on media agency\nAlan Rutherford of Ebiquity: Cannes Lions marks a new era of more professional media management\nProof that data works - for savvy goalies anyway\nbroadsign smart cities 2018-08-09\nStephen Foster\nAbout Stephen Foster\nStephen is a former editor of Marketing Week and London Evening Standard advertising columnist.

Back in December 2009, Google Public DNS launched and the service just\xc2\xa0celebrated\xc2\xa0its 8.8.8.8 anniversary, while teasing upcoming announcements in light of increased competition.\nThis particular anniversary occurred yesterday on August 12th, 2018 at 12:30 AM UTC and marks eight years, eight months, eight days, and eight hours since the original announcement. Google chose this occasion to coincide with how the public IP address of its Public DNS service is 8.8.8.8 (and 8.8.4.4). It\xe2\x80\x99s memorability helps when users configure network settings and set their DNS servers.\nGoogle notes a recent study that pegs usage of 8.8.8.8 at 10% of internet users. As the largest public DNS resolver, hundreds of millions of users result in a trillion queries served per day. A \xe2\x80\x9cbig part\xe2\x80\x9d of growth comes from free public internet, like services in San Francisco parks and\xc2\xa0LinkNYC kiosk hotspots.\nIt is also used by Google Station in Indian railway locations, while ISPs in Africa and Southeast Asia rely on it to resolve customer DNS queries, with Google noting that it\xe2\x80\x99s in line\xc2\xa0with the\xc2\xa0Next Billion Users initiative. Additionally, in recent history, Google Public DNS played a role in getting Turkish users online after the government blocked Twitter.\nBack in 2009, Google\xe2\x80\x99s goal for launching a public DNS resolver was to make the web faster by leveraging its\xc2\xa0global data center and caching infrastructure.\nGoogle Public DNS resolvers\xe2\x80\x99 DNS caches hold tens of billions of entries worldwide. And because hundreds of millions of clients use them every day, they usually return the address for your domain queries without extra lookups, connecting you to the internet that much faster.\nOn the security front, Google published a privacy practice statement noting what the collected information is used for \xe2\x80\x9cand how it\xe2\x80\x99s not used,\xe2\x80\x9d while also working to secure it from hijacking attempts and denial of service attacks.\nLooking forward, Google acknowledges recent and notable entries into the space, including\xc2\xa0Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s 1.1.1.1 in April. Noting that security is still a focus, Google teased \xe2\x80\x9cexciting Google Public DNS announcements in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCheck out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:\nGuides\nGoogle Public DNS\nAbout the Author\nAbner Li\n@technacity\nEditor.

Pois bem: no \xc3\xbaltimo domingo (12), a gigante comemorou oito anos, oito meses, oito dias e oito horas de exist\xc3\xaancia do DNS, exatamente \xc3\xa0s 0h30.\nA companhia, ent\xc3\xa3o, preparou uma publica\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o em seu blog de seguran\xc3\xa7a para celebrar a ocasi\xc3\xa3o, nos lembrando da import\xc3\xa2ncia de seu DNS p\xc3\xbablico para manter a internet mais veloz em todo o mundo. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks, ou Redes de Distribui\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de Conte\xc3\xbados) usam bastante o DNS p\xc3\xbablico da Google, sendo elas redes de servidores que armazenam r\xc3\xa9plicas de conte\xc3\xbados de outros sites em cache e, depois, as entrega aos visitantes, conectando-os ao servidor mais pr\xc3\xb3ximo e mais veloz naquele momento \xe2\x80\x94 reduzindo, portanto, a lat\xc3\xaancia (tempo de transfer\xc3\xaancia dos dados). Segundo as informa\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb5es da companhia, os DNS 8.8.8.8 e 8.8.4.4 s\xc3\xa3o usados por mais de 10% de todos os usu\xc3\xa1rios da internet global como DNS prim\xc3\xa1rio, com a realiza\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de mais de um trilh\xc3\xa3o de consultas di\xc3\xa1rias. "Quando iniciamos o projeto em 2007, a Google j\xc3\xa1 havia agilizado a busca na web, mas ainda demorava um pouco. Naquela \xc3\xa9poca, a maioria das pesquisas de DNS usava os resolvedores de seu provedor e, com caches pequenos, muitas vezes precisavam fazer v\xc3\xa1rias consultas ao DNS antes de retornarem um endere\xc3\xa7o", explica a gigante.Participe do nosso Grupo de Cupons e Descontos no Whatsapp e garanta sempre o menor pre\xc3\xa7o em suas compras de produtos de tecnologia. As CDNs dependem, portanto, da velocidade para transmitir v\xc3\xaddeos ou jogos sem atrasos, por exemplo, mas o DNS p\xc3\xbablico da Google tamb\xc3\xa9m \xc3\xa9 usado por servi\xc3\xa7os de conex\xc3\xa3o p\xc3\xbablica, como \xc3\xa9 o caso dos hotspots da LinkNYC, nos EUA, e tamb\xc3\xa9m da Google Station na \xc3\x8dndia.\nFonte: Google Security Blog\nGostou dessa mat\xc3\xa9ria?\nInscreva seu email no Canaltech para receber atualiza\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb5es di\xc3\xa1rias com as \xc3\xbaltimas not\xc3\xadcias do mundo da tecnologia.\nSua inscri\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o foi registrada.

The aim of using domain name systems like 8.8.8.8 is to make the internet faster for users, safeguard the privacy, and access internet sites more reliably and securely.\nCurrently, over 10% of the internet users rely on 8.8.8.8, and it serves more than a trillion queries every day. A big part of the protocol comes from free public internet, such as Google Station services offered by Indian railway stations, parks in San Francisco, LinkNYC kiosk hotspots etc.\nOn the occasion of numerological anniversary, the search engine giant announced a number of upcoming improvements to the protocol.\nGoogle said that accelerating the DNS responses is just one part of making the web faster, but getting the web content from servers closer to the users can have the bigger impact. The content delivery networks (CDNs) use DNS for directing users to nearest servers for distribution of content like video streaming to the users. When the ISP resolver is far away from the user, it can impact loading time.\nThe search engine giant will continue to improve the EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) extension, such as adding automatic detection of name server ECS support. the support for ECS is now widespread among CDNs.\nOn the privacy front, Google is strengthening the way it collects and uses information. Google is working in the IETF and with other DNS operators on the Internet Draft for DNS Queries over HTTPS specification.\nAdditionally, the ability of Google Public DNS to protect the integrity of DNS responses is also being improved. It will be able to block DNS denial of service attacks by limiting the rate of queries to name servers and reflection that flood network connections.\nAlso read: Internet domain names will soon be available in Indian regional scripts\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, we continue to improve Google Public DNS both behind the scenes and in ways visible to users, adding features that users want from their DNS service,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Google in a blog post.\nRate this post\n8.8.8.8 content delivery networks DNS resolver Domain Name System Google Public DNS\nShare This Post\nRelated Articles\nAlphabet\xe2\x80\x99s Jigsaw launches new app to protect users against DNS manipulation\nOctober 5, 2018\nMozilla moves its DNS over HTTPS protocol testing to Beta phase\nSeptember 17, 2018\nCloudflare launches DNS resolver 1.1.1.1 for faster and privacy-focused internet experience\nApril 2, 2018\nIt costs $715,000 to mitigate a DNS attack in 2018: EfficientIP report\nJune 13, 2018\nGoogle secures DNS traffic with DNS-over-TLS support for its public DNS\nJanuary 10, 2019\nICANN will change DNS root key next month to strengthen security of domain name system\nSeptember 20, 2018\nMany organizations unprepared for DNS attacks, reveals new global survey\nOctober 6, 2017\nGet ready to experience hyperscale enablement, cloud, data and other internet innovations at CloudFest 2019\nMarch 14, 2019\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnApp Storage Grows as the Service Provider\xe2\x80\x99s Cloud Grows\xe2\x80\x9d- Kosten Metreweli, OnApp\nMarch 8, 2013\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\nYour email address will not be published.

That\xe2\x80\x99s the number of discrete advertisements, both online and off, served to me over the course of one Tuesday in July. I know because I counted each and every one.Why catalog the informational noise that, in many cases, our brains have quite literally trained themselves to ignore? Hidden in plain sight, ad money is the invisible force that subsidizes many of the services we depend on\xe2\x80\x94especially online, where keeping up with friends, reading the news, or streaming music is ostensibly \xe2\x80\x9cfree.\xe2\x80\x9d I wanted to to find out exactly what my eyeballs are worth.AdvertisementStarting outAfter turning off ad blockers on both my work and home laptops, I did my best to have a normal day, making no effort to avoid or intentionally expose myself to ads. The act of writing down each instance of advertising may have slowed down my usual browsing pace slightly, but otherwise this was a regular Tuesday: working from home for a few hours, commuting from Brooklyn to Manhattan, walking to meet a friend in the East Village after work, taking a cab back, and catching up on more work at home while watching TV. Bland as this routine is, it put me in front of a variety of digital ads on desktop and mobile, as well as what are called \xe2\x80\x9cout of home ads,\xe2\x80\x9d which include things like physical posters and billboards.AdvertisementForcing yourself to notice and comprehend each ad you encounter in a day is, it must be said, a thoroughly unrewarding experience. It had been over a decade since I really browsed the web without plugins like uBlock Origin and Canvas Defender. Boy, has it become a cluttered and ugly place. Amazingly, around 75 percent of Americans look at the internet this way. Given the obnoxious tactics used by advertisers (popovers, ad units that follow you on scroll, auto-playing videos with sound), irrelevant products promoted, and ever-growing volume of ad units per page, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder users have learned to ignore these impositions.Why did I do this?Screenshot:\nBryan Menegus (Gizmodo)AdvertisementTo make this experiment achievable, the only ads I counted were ones where a company paid for time or space someplace they did not already control. Store awnings, branded delivery vehicles, product reviews, and HBO\xe2\x80\x99s self-promotional spots were all excluded for this reason. I applied the same exception to incidentally advertorial merchandise, like the guy wearing a Pepsi shirt on my train ride. Sure, these are powerful tools for raising brand awareness, but they\xe2\x80\x99re difficult (if not impossible) to ascribe direct monetary value to\xe2\x80\x94not that any part of this experiment is quite up to scientific snuff.One more note: Most ad companies do not make their rate sheets public and aren\xe2\x80\x99t keen to share those figures with reporters or the general public. Unless otherwise stated, all companies brokering these ads were contacted and declined to respond.AdvertisementLogging onDesktop advertisements made up a little less than half of my daily ad total and (despite some distracting news dropping that day) I expected the percentage to be much higher. Maybe it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come as a surprise, given the research Pew and other organizations have put out regarding the prevalence of Americans getting their news from social media. In my case, I was also getting the day\xe2\x80\x99s news by scanning headlines on RSS, Google and IFTTT alerts, and push notifications from the New York Times, Reuters, CNN, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal apps. Clicking into an article was pretty strictly reserved for things I had a strong inclination to believe would be relevant to the beats I write on, and each story spat out between one and four ads, based mostly on how deep on the page I scrolled.AdvertisementOne of the most common ways online ads are priced\xe2\x80\x94especially the traditional banner ad\xe2\x80\x94is called CPM (cost per mille), the amount of money needed to serve that ad to 1,000 people. I brought a list of these ads, including information about where they appeared on a page and what elements they contained, to Jillian Schulz, Gizmodo Media\xe2\x80\x99s VP of Media Operations and Ryan Brown, our SVP of Business Development. The two of them provided what they felt were conservative market rate CPMs for each, with the consideration that the sites I\xe2\x80\x99d visited were largely established, well-trafficked news sites. Their estimates ranged from $5 for static banner ads along the right \xe2\x80\x9crail\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a section of the screen many users ignore outright\xe2\x80\x94up to $30 for autoplaying video ads.Included in this section are ads from Reddit, Google, and the RSS reader Feedly (R.I.P. Digg Reader). Reddit browsing for me usually involves a peek at the site through some multi-Reddits I have for specific subjects, which aren\xe2\x80\x99t equipped to promote posts. The absolute minimum CPM on Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s self-serve ad product is 50 cents, but frontpage targeting appears to only be available through managed campaigns, which require a minimum spend of $50,000. Jillian and Ryan felt $1.50 was a safe CPM to use for these posts. Feedly\xe2\x80\x99s text-only ads, which are slotted into the feed, they pegged at $0.75 per mille. Google\xe2\x80\x99s sponsored search results are most commonly priced per click, abbreviated CPC. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t click any of them, so those likely didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost their advertisers a thing to show me.AdvertisementEstimated Cost to Advertisers:\n$0.824Making my way downtownWith a little under an hour to kill, I tend to listen to podcasts on my way into work\xe2\x80\x94in this case, two short ones (NPR\xe2\x80\x99s The Indicator and Death, Sex & Money) each with one ad, and half of a longer one (Maximum Fun\xe2\x80\x99s My Brother My Brother and Me) with two. According to David Raphael, the President of Public Media Marketing\xe2\x80\x94a company that works with Maximum Fun, as well as shows like This American Life and The Joe Rogan Experience\xe2\x80\x94podcast product spots tend to be \xe2\x80\x9cstickier\xe2\x80\x9d than many other forms of advertising, and command relatively high prices as a result. In his telling, typically market rates span from a $20 CPM up to $60. Without knowing the listenership numbers of any of these shows, I went with $20 across the board.AdvertisementThe next part of the equation is public transit, and unlike digital ads, where eyeballs and clicks can be directly tracked, out of home ads tend to be a little squishier. Where cost is concerned, the only person to respond to my inquiries on subway ads was Danny Pouladian, the director of an ad broking firm called Blue Line Media, who sent over when he called \xe2\x80\x9cvery rough numbers\xe2\x80\x9d for various four-week campaigns\xe2\x80\x94typically the shortest buy for out of home\xe2\x80\x94that were priced to reach 25 percent \xe2\x80\x9cshare of voice\xe2\x80\x9d (SOV) meaning a quarter of all people in Manhattan. (According to a study from NYU\xe2\x80\x99s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, the total number of people in the city, including commuters, is around 4 million people daily.)Going off his figures, the daily cost for an ad plastered to the side of a bus is a little more than $35, while interior subway ads\xe2\x80\x94of which there are often a dozen or more per car\xe2\x80\x94are less than $2 each. Given the audience scale we\xe2\x80\x99re operating with here, these all amount to an absolute pittance. Even using the figures listed on Blue Line\xe2\x80\x99s website, which don\xe2\x80\x99t specifically mention a target SOV percentage, dividing those costs by the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s estimated ridership for my stop (15,269) still did little to unbury the individual pricing from beneath a slew of zeros.AdvertisementMost of these campaigns are expensive on their face, and a far cry from Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s self-serve minimum daily spend of $5. A \xe2\x80\x9cstation domination,\xe2\x80\x9d the horrendously named practice of a brand plastering itself over nearly every square inch of a subway stop (as Taskrabbit did to Union Square on this particular day), is estimated by Pouladian\xe2\x80\x99s firm to cost \xe2\x80\x9c$25,000 - $75,000 or more\xe2\x80\x9d for a four-week run. Account for an average weekday ridership at Union Square of 107,141 people, and each of those commuters is worth between an eighth of a cent and two-and-a-half cents.One of the most frequent out of home ads I (and probably every other New Yorker) sees are the illuminated miniature billboards on the tops of cabs, called taxi toppers. John Schweikert, President of Strong Digital Media\xe2\x80\x94one of the Taxi and Limousine Commission\xe2\x80\x99s largest brokers of such placements\xe2\x80\x94was kind enough to provide an approximate CPM of $1. Bus shelters also double as ad spots, and without anyone willing to comment on local costs, I opted to use the CPM for Los Angeles (designated \xe2\x80\x9cMarket Area #2,\xe2\x80\x9d right behind NYC) from Clear Channel\xe2\x80\x99s rate sheet. Many sidewalks in New York now feature Link NYC terminals for phone charging. The sides of those function as targetable, digital banners, with average ad CPMs of between $8 and $12, a figure the company provided me over the phone and then attempted to walk back on in an email. Even the elevator in the building Gizmodo works out of has a screen that continuously cycles through ads, which are served through a company called Captivate. They provided me an estimated $10.60 CPM for the buildings in our neighborhood, making it one of the more expensive offerings, but, well, what else is there to do in an elevator?AdvertisementOn the cab ride home I also came across one traditional billboard, located on Delancey Street heading onto the Williamsburg Bridge. Lamar, the company that rents out that billboard, estimates a cost of $10,500 to $17,500 for a four-week campaign on that size and style of billboard in the New York metro area. The most recent New York City Bridge Traffic Volumes report states that 105,645 vehicles go over the Williamsburg Bridge each day, and the Federal Highway Administration estimates 1.7 passengers as the average vehicle occupancy. Some light arithmetic, and that\xe2\x80\x99s $0.002 to $0.0036 per rider.The last out of home category here is probably the oddest, in that it accounts for both the ad and its own infrastructure: Citi Bike. Each bike and docking station is covered in Citi branding, and Citigroup has invested a total of $11.5 million to support the bikesharing project it started in 2013 through 2024. Rather than than calculate this per bike, I went by station: I walked past two of the 750 that currently exist. The New York Times estimates walking a city block takes approximately one minute, and looking at said branded bike dock for that minute costs Citigroup just over two and a half tenths of a cent. Does anyone at Citigroup calculate the value of a bikeshare this way? Probably not, particularly because one person noticing a rack of indestructible blue bikes doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude anyone else from noticing it. But for this particular goose chase I do could not come up with a better estimation, because what little foot traffic data I could find for New York is woefully incomplete.AdvertisementEstimated Cost to Advertisers: $0.1852388Subtotal: $1.0092388The sadness rectangleAn outsized portion of my smartphone\xe2\x80\x99s usage boils down to checking social platforms. And unlike desktop client Tweetdeck, Twitter on mobile is littered with ads. Instagram and Tumblr still cross my tiny screen, if less often these days, but I rarely check Facebook at all, thanks, in part, to a similarly harebrained experiment.AdvertisementA Tumblr representative was kind enough to confirm to me that the network\xe2\x80\x99s ads are all priced on a CPC basis. Once again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really click (or tap) ads ever, so that\xe2\x80\x99s worth nothing. Surprisingly, Jillian and Ryan indicated that that was the case with many static social ads\xe2\x80\x94the outliers being promoted tweets with autoplaying videos embedded, and Instagram stories (which also autoplay.) They suggested a $20 CPM for anything of that nature. Instagram advertisers tend to bundle two or three stories into a single ad package, and since I find tapping faster than swiping, those all factored into the total.The biggest headache in this otherwise breezy chunk of the project was the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cpromoted trends\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s way of letting brands buy their own hashtag campaigns. On this particular day, #christopherrobin was trending at the behest of the Walt Disney Corporation (thanks, guys). The only public data on the cost of these campaigns comes from early 2013, when Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s user base was about half what it is now, and the company had not yet gone public. Back then, a promoted hashtag was reported to cost around $200,000. Around that time the service had recently hit 200 million users, giving us a nice, round $0.001 each.AdvertisementEstimated Cost to Advertisers: $0.401Subtotal: $1.4102388Pivot to videoBeing a millenial, it\xe2\x80\x99s my moral duty to avoid cable at all costs and replace it with a series of equally janky video services. Over the course of that Tuesday, my video regimen consisted of YouTube, Twitch, and the lower-tier ad-supported Hulu membership I borrow from a friend.AdvertisementFor pre-roll ads on the former two, Jillian and Ryan again went with a $30 CPM\xe2\x80\x94although YouTube also uses small, semi-opaque banner overlays inside the video player ($1.50) and standard right-rail banners above suggested \xe2\x80\x9cup next\xe2\x80\x9d videos ($5).Hulu is fairly secretive about their ad rates, but a report from Digiday published last November cites CPMs \xe2\x80\x9cin the mid-$30 to $40 range.\xe2\x80\x9d Conservatively, we\xe2\x80\x99ll call that $35, and given how aggressively the service inserts ads, binging a few episodes of reality knife-making show Forged in Fire was worth over a dollar.AdvertisementEstimated Cost to Advertisers: $1.2825Total: $2.6927388ConclusionsOf course, there were a few things I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even venture a guess on. The cost of the vinyl banners around Union Square for a music showcase series (also sponsored by Citigroup) remain a mystery, as do things like subway escalator wraps and the posters glued to the sides of New York\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling public payphones. And I got to $2.69 using conservative estimates. Even if we assumed that the true cost is closer to double that due to lapses in cataloging and pricing these ads, it would still barely buy you a coffee and a bagel.AdvertisementMore than anything else, trudging through the numbers on these various campaigns got me thinking about information pollution, and the sheer amount of space in our day that\xe2\x80\x99s monetized. Introducing limits sounds pleasant enough\xe2\x80\x94who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want fewer ads?\xe2\x80\x94but that might also tip the balance even further in favor of huge brands with budgets to burn on the ad spaces that would become costlier through artificial scarcity. Maybe aggressive ad density could be taxed like cigarettes, air pollution, or anything else with negative externalities. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the first or last person to see the reliance on advertising\xe2\x80\x94especially online\xe2\x80\x94as flawed, and we should all be deeply concerned by the way it incentivizes the sort of mass data collection Facebook and Google do.The low total I reached seemed, at first, to be an argument in favor of paywalling the world. Would I spend $3 a day to never see an ad for the rest of my natural life? In a heartbeat. But this total really only represents half the story. $2.69 is what it costs brands to buy that real estate and have it reach one living, breathing, spending human, not the value of the advertising to those brands\xe2\x80\x94and to know that number would require proprietary data on each campaign as well as their specific goals. I would imagine the value figure is considerably higher. And in any case, paywalls on every major site would a) be a consumer nightmare and b) is an inherently classist approach that would likely harm those who already have the least access to libraries, good public schools, and other traditional sources of information. Advertising isn\xe2\x80\x99t my area of expertise, nor is economics, and for the time being I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer a picture of a better path forward.AdvertisementAs a small, semi-scientific experiment, however, I did go into this assuming my eyes and ears would be more expensive. It\xe2\x80\x99s left me feeling a little short-changed, and given that I write online for a living, somewhat guilty that my paycheck is at least partly contingent on the irritation and inconvenience websites inflict on people just trying to find out what the hell is going on in the world. If some measure of self-worth is what you\xe2\x80\x99re after, I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend looking into advertising as the avenue to find it.Share This StoryRecommended StoriesFacebook Wants to Overhaul Its News Feed\xe2\x80\x94I Made Mine Empty Instead\xc2\xa0Who Killed YTMND?\xc2\xa072 Hours in Model Horse MeccaAbout the authorBryan MenegusBryan MenegusSenior reporter.

I had to explain floppy disks. Talk about feeling old.Answer: That\xe2\x80\x99s not a question, but we know exactly what you mean. Just wait until they watch \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFriends\xe2\x80\x9d reruns from the 1990s and ask you about answering machines. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to go that far back: I watched an episode of \xe2\x80\x9cMonk\xe2\x80\x9d with my son last week and during a scene in which a character witnesses a crime from yards away, he asked \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t that guy just record it using his phone?\xe2\x80\x9d This episode aired in 2002.Your observation got us thinking: What else will our kids grow up knowing nothing about because of advances in technology?\nJust about anything even remotely related to phones has been obsoleted in the past two decades. Seeing a phone book on the doorstep evokes Mitch Hedberg\xe2\x80\x99s take on being handed a flyer.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x98Here \xe2\x80\x93 you throw this away.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d A popular observation posted to Twitter recently: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my kid watches \xe2\x80\x98Terminator,\xe2\x80\x99 I will have to explain the concept of a phone book, but not an autonomous robot killing machine.\xe2\x80\x9d (bit.ly/1tzacue)Phone booths are in the same camp. A recent quip on the web suggested that Superman\xe2\x80\x99s work of late has been hindered by the lack of suitable places to change into character. One company has a plan to make them useful again by installing Wi-Fi equipment (www.link.nyc), so maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll stick around in some form. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird to think that our kids will never use a pay phone.Does anyone without grandkids call a \xe2\x80\x9ctime-and-temp\xe2\x80\x9d number? Speaking of \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld,\xe2\x80\x9d that whole \xe2\x80\x9cKramer as Moviefone\xe2\x80\x9d gag probably won\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense in a few years either. And anyone who was once spooked because \xe2\x80\x9cthe call came from inside the house\xe2\x80\x9d now is more likely to greet an unknown caller with \xe2\x80\x9cNew phone Who dis?\xe2\x80\x9dEven the term \xe2\x80\x9clandline phone\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to distinguish them from mobile phones \xe2\x80\x93 is a retronym, once unnecessary as there were no other types of phones.

Good luck re-creating that sound for your kids. And while camera phones have not made camera cameras obsolete (just yet), little Timmy will never know the frustration of having his vacation photos erased from his camera\xe2\x80\x99s film by the airport X-rays.The publishing landscape has changed significantly as well. For school research papers, you probably went to a library and flipped through an encyclopedia, whereas your kids will start by consulting Wikipedia from the home computer (or tablet, or phone). Anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?\nBig-city libraries now are transforming from book storehouses into glorified computer labs, with the emphasis on learning, just in different ways. Newspapers, magazines and books won\xe2\x80\x99t go away anytime soon, but will be consumed more on tablets and other devices with screens.Prepare to hear this: \xe2\x80\x9cMommy, what are pen pals?\xe2\x80\x9d Your kids are much less likely to ever mail a letter (much less write one in cursive), and the USPS will increasingly be seen as a way for companies to send you junk every day. Or at least as just the delivery arm of Amazon. And here\xe2\x80\x99s something you\xe2\x80\x99ll never say again: \xe2\x80\x9cGrab the map so we can find our way to Blockbuster to rent a movie.\xe2\x80\x9dOf course, physical media used to store music always changes rapidly (from vinyl records to audio tapes to CDs, just to summarize one PropellerHead\xe2\x80\x99s experience). It will be fun to explain how we had to plan our entire evenings around the TV schedule \xe2\x80\x93 if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t home by 8:30 on Thursdays, you were going to miss \xe2\x80\x9cFamily Ties\xe2\x80\x9d and would have to wait for a rerun.As always, the ground continues to move under our feet even now. It will take a while longer, but online banking will eventually make checks seem as antiquated to a future generation as the milkman seems to us now. Already, iPads are replacing restaurant bills and receipts.Most frightening to us is the prospect of a future where all technology columns are written by super-intelligent robots without the aid of humans.

Fixated on the fact that only actual lifeboats could be their transport to safety, people overlooked the size and shape of different objects that could play the same role but in different ways.\nWhen it comes to innovation, businesses are constantly hampered by functional fixedness and other cognitive biases that cause people to overlook elegant solutions hidden in plain sight. As creative as we are as an industry, advertisers have become too used to seeing outdoor media as an effective way for mass advertising. This is certainly the case, but what if we could see outdoor media as native content for cities?\nAnd, what if the vast network of billboards, street furniture and panels could actually help alleviate the problems cities face and this way enable new revenue models? Do I have your attention now?!\nOffering a new outlook\nAlthough cities only occupy 2% of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s landmass, they are where 75% of resource consumption and the majority of brand communications are concentrated. Due to increased demand for ever more comfortable lifestyles, the existing urban infrastructures have been feeling their \xe2\x80\x98growing pains\xe2\x80\x99 for decades now. From energy to education, health, waste-management or safety, cities\xe2\x80\x99 services are struggling to keep up with their larger, older and \xe2\x80\x98hungrier\xe2\x80\x99 populations.\nMoreover, our global media and advertising footprint also comes with a hefty environmental toll. In the UK, for instance, advertising is responsible for two million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to heating 50% of London\xe2\x80\x99s social housing.\nAccording to recent research led by Diana Ivanova from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, only around 20% of emissions for which we are individually responsible comes from direct usage, such as driving a car or having a shower.\nThe rest is all hidden in the supply chains of what we buy. And between production and purchase lies promotion, the last frontier in terms of redesigning our economy from linear to circular.\nTo take the leap we must drop the functional fixedness in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been conditioned to believe by using brands\xe2\x80\x99 touch points as more than mere messengers to supplementing public utility services and minimising carbon dioxide emissions.\nSuch logic is able to turn advertising into a regenerative force for cities, where the promotion of goods and services is not only more profitable, but also environmentally enriching and socially virtuous.\nI have coined this Urban Brand-Utility (UBU), an approach that can meaningfully reconnect advertisers with people and the public and private sectors. For example, according to the World Health Organisation, 80 percent of global urban dwellers breathe bad air \xe2\x80\x93 increasing mortality rates, structural unemployment and greatly compromising our overall well-being.\nThe cost of addressing the problem amounts to millions of dollars and we are still far from solving it. Importantly, the main cause of pollution is rapid industrialisation, which, in turn, is driven by urbanisation.\nIn 2014, following a construction boom in Peru, Lima\xe2\x80\x99s University of Technology (UTEC) deployed air-purifying billboards, each claiming to be as effective as 1200 trees and occupying a much smaller area. In Manila, Coca-Cola created a billboard made up of 3600 Fukien tea plants, which combined removed almost nearly 23,000 kilograms (50,000 pounds) of carbon dioxide in a year.\nAt the University of Sheffield in the UK, a billboard coated with microscopic particles of titanium dioxide can now eradicate the equivalent to the pollution created by about 20 cars every day. It costs \xc2\xa3100 (AU$180.75) to coat a standard billboard with the benefit of turning advertisements into catalysts in more ways than one.\nThe above (and several other similar campaigns that preceded and followed), however, were all one-off activations. Those are great for consumer awareness and advertising award entries, but short-sighted in terms of embracing a bigger commercial opportunity while addressing society\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing issues.\nMuch more is required to create a reliable network of creative urban resilience. But according to the 2015 World Economic Forum\xe2\x80\x99s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Cities: \xe2\x80\x9cCities will always need large infrastructure projects, but sometimes small-scale infrastructure can also have a big impact on an urban area.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTowards a network of creative urban resilience\nTo do good, we must also do well. Advertising is the soul of the capitalist system and the best incentive to upgrading it is by creating new revenue streams. For one, a brand that shows itself relevant and useful is more likely to cut through the noise and increase sales. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also a bigger commercial model to be explored. First, by definition, UBU programs have three core objectives:\nenabling savings or new earnings for cities\ncreating urban shared value to the cities\xe2\x80\x99 inhabitants, and\ndelivering superior return on media investment (ROMI).\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical situation. Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that UTEC\xe2\x80\x99s air-purifying billboard was able to generate a $10 million surplus to the city of Lima by minimising the costs from dealing with air pollution. Rather than treating this as a one-off campaign, smart mayors would try and create a virtuous cycle, where 50% of the surplus is retained by the city, 25% is returned to the advertiser and 25% to the agency and media owner \xe2\x80\x93 a value only unlocked by repeating the approach. The more advertisers communicate their messages in a way that benefits brand, people and city, the cheaper it becomes to do more of it. And, the more cities encourage such an approach the faster societal problems would be addressed. In other words, UBU programs become a catalyst, igniting brand love, smartening cities and improving their economies, as shown on the model below.\nAs with the idea of a circular economy where products and services go beyond an end user\xe2\x80\x99s finite life-cycle, UBU looks at brand communications as closed loops by designing a system bigger than fixed campaign periods, target audiences and business-as-usual KPIs. This way, marketing budgets are effectively turned into investment funds with returns in the form of brand cut-through, happier customers, social impact and more effective city management.\nWith one billion people migrating to cities by 2030, a billion-dollar opportunity is emerging for pioneering marketers to make an impact that goes beyond their target audiences and brands\xe2\x80\x99 bottom lines. The University of Melbourne has already confirmed that the impact assessment of UBU programs is possible and would inform new revenue models and policy-making efforts.\nDr Savvas Verdis, infrastructure economist at Siemens and Senior Research Fellow at LSE Cities at the London School of Economics, is equally convinced: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that Urban Brand-Utility will provide some much needed expertise and transformation [in the brand communications industry] and particularly in generating new business opportunities for infrastructure, development, tech companies and others tendering with cities through an innovative use of media.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn this more useful and integrated new world, agencies and their clients would partner with cities and media-owners via open data platforms, matching brands with specific urban challenges and forming the foundations of a network of creative, urban resilience.\nRadically innovative skills and propositions would emerge from the frictions between marketers and creatives working closer to urban planners, policy-makers, landscape architects and many others. Interestingly, in September 2016, the City of Gainesville, Florida in the US and design firm IDEO co-created the Department of Doing, aiming at creating a more competitive economy and becoming more citizen-responsive.\nThinking locally, acting globally\nTo make the model scalable, however, a digitised mechanism \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to IDEO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98private-public bureau\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 would be required. An interesting case of civic engagement enabled by outdoor media has recently gone live in New York City.\nThe Participatory Budgeting campaign invited New Yorkers to decide how to spend US$1 million of the public budget through digital panels spread across the city. This means that the same touch point used to communicate is also used to enable the action it asks audiences to undertake \xe2\x80\x93 a paradigm shift where advertising can finally walk its talk.\nThe company behind the \xe2\x80\x98voting outdoor panels\xe2\x80\x99, Intersection, started up by repurposing New York City\xe2\x80\x99s now obsolete pay phones as totems offering free broadband Wi-Fi connectivity to residents and visitors, and media space for advertisers.\nBesides supplementing New York\xe2\x80\x99s broadband network and now enhancing civic life, the LinkNYC totems have projected an incremental US$500 million in ad revenue for the city as part of a 12-year contract, by unlocking new value from underutilised assets.\nJust like the Ancient Greek public squares \xe2\x80\x93 the agoras \xe2\x80\x93 where direct democracy was born, this emerging participatory media can effectively collect complaints and suggestions for cities\xe2\x80\x99 improvement, in real-time. The next step for this could then be the matching of brands that align with a specific urban challenge. This way, traditional public-private partnerships are flipped on their heads.\nInstead of top-down municipal contracts, issues are identified by local constituents informing future UBU programs, as wanted by the people and enabled by outdoor media.The technology is not yet globally available, but any advertiser wanting to shift brand interactions from interrupting people to enhancing their moments are certainly able to game-change from business-as-usual to the deployment of temporary branded utilities and, ultimately, implement longer-term (18 months or more) UBU programs.\nThis can be done by following six strategic imperatives:\nTranslate the big idea that defines your brand into a big utility that can operationalise its impact.\nReplace interruptive interactions with enhancing ones by delivering a public utility service.\nTurn any existing utility of a communications effort from a stunt into a sustained practice.\nShift your business focus from short-term sales results to longer-term profitability.\nBroaden your audiences from customers to citizens, expanding paths-to-purchase onto life journeys.\nDiversify revenue from sales to the creation of shared value.\nIn this \xe2\x80\x98Brand City\xe2\x80\x99 construct, consumers are \xe2\x80\x98emancipated\xe2\x80\x99 as citizens with every purchase effectively counting as a vote, electing the most useful brands and respective media deployment as a more integral part of their individual and communal lives. Importantly, this new model allows brands to connect with people in a more meaningful way and cut through the clutter that is suffocating the industry.\nMedia and advertising have powered a linear economy that is now facing severe challenges. The strategic opportunity is to bend the line and turn the existing infrastructure into new utilities that benefit all parties involved and educates everyone in the value-chain. Markets, choice and competition are not just a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, but their civic representation.\nAs reported by numerous sources, the general population does want brands to be more civically engaged; however, the difference between \xe2\x80\x98expressing\xe2\x80\x99 your brand and \xe2\x80\x98taking action\xe2\x80\x99 through it is that the latter can effectively make a difference for media owner, agency, advertiser, city and, ultimately, its residents.

Kiosks will eventually be situated in each of Newark\xe2\x80\x99s five wards, near major traffic centers such as Newark Penn Station and prominent corridors such as Broad Street, Market Street and Clinton Avenue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNewark is at the forefront of technology and leveraging it for the public and economic development,\xe2\x80\x9d Aisha Glover, CEO and president of NCEDC, said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to just have free and public Wi-Fi, but residents and businesses need to trust that their experience is fast and safe. We are happy to play a role in bringing this exciting technology to Newark and continue our trajectory as a tech hub.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNWK is the result of a collaboration between the city, NCEDC and New Jersey Institute of Technology that enables residents to benefit from the Newark Fiber program, designed to bring affordable gigabit internet to the city.\nThe network will be free, as it is supported by advertising.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike many public Wi-Fi networks, the LinkNWK network will ensure a secure, encrypted connection for all Apple and Android phones through the Link Wi-Fi app,\xe2\x80\x9d Jen Hensley, president of Link at Intersection, said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are excited to be working with our partners in Newark to increase access to the internet and raise the bar on security at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRead more from ROI-NJ on LinkNWK:\nIntersection chairman: LinkNWK, a free public Wi-Fi platform, is about the future\nNewark to become fourth city in world to implement Link, a free network of advanced Wi-Fi services\nRelated\nEric Strauss | estrauss@roi-nj.com |\nacerimrat\nRead more from ROI-NJ\nWyndham adds Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Galt House Hotel to roster\nNAI Hanson negotiates office building sale\nToys R Us, the last 48 hours: Chaos, then a sense of calm \xe2\x80\x94 and even gratefulness\nAt Kearny Point, helicopter photo firm expands its space\nCool \xe2\x80\xa6 and red-hot: ProSight has achieved incredible growth by focusing on most niche of insurance markets\nMore By Eric Strauss\nLiberty Science Center to honor 4 scientists at Genius Gala\nState chamber adds six to board of directors\nGerber moving HQ from Florham Park to Va.; 180 jobs to leave state\nParsippany office building sold for $66M, HFF says\nEdison Partners sells stake in ComplySci to Vista Equity\nAlso in Tech\nIntertrust N.V. acquires Somerset-based Viteos for $330M\nCognizant to acquire Zenith Technologies\nBusinesses must notify customers of breach involving certain personal data \xe2\x80\x94 but N.J. has changed what that is\nDun & Bradstreet to acquire AI customer data platform\nCarolan, Ciano, Riccio earn Hall of Fame honor from NJ Tech Council\nGet a return on your information.

Intersection, the company behind LinkNYC and LinkNWK public Wi-Fi kiosks in New York City and Newark, N.J., is now offering an app to secure connections on its networks.\nThe Link Wi-Fi App will provide an encrypted connection between the device and the network and will ensure that devices don\xe2\x80\x99t connect to other \xe2\x80\x9cevil twin\xe2\x80\x9d networks, which would allow bad actors to steal and view user information, Stacey Levine, the VP of communications at Intersection, told GCN.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only sure-fire way to avoid these evil-twin networks is to use a secure method of network access such as an app and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of the encrypted app.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe security of public Wi-Fi networks is increasingly an area of focus for cities who want to protect their residents and visitors from hackers, imposter networks and other threats that can compromise or steal user data, often without users even realizing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection President Jen Hensley said. \xe2\x80\x9cUnlike many public wifi networks, the LinkNWK network will ensure a secure, encrypted connection for all Apple and Android phones through the Link Wi-Fi app.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNWK will be the first city to have the app when it activates its 45 kiosks later this fall, Levine said.\nLinkNYC has both a public and private network. LinkNYC Private requires downloading a Hotspot 2.0 profile that enables encryption and automatically connects users from one hotspot to the next without requiring them to log in to each new network. It also recently signed a deal with Quad9 to secure its guest and free public Wi-Fi networks by blocking access to known malicious sites.\nLink Wi-Fi App will instead be downloaded like any standard smartphone app, a process users are more familiar with, Levine said, and it will be available for iOS and Android users.\nThe app will automatically connect a device to the LinkNWK network any time it is within range. It will also provide a map of nearby active kiosks. Future updates could provide the ability to access information similar to what people can see on the kiosks themselves -- including events, city information and transit updates.\nThis app will also give Intersection data for monitoring internet connectivity. Analysts will be able to see when people have trouble connecting and if the problem is due to a specific operating system or device, which will help the service to troubleshoot, Levine said.\nLinkNWK taps into Newark's fiber network for internet connectivity. For LinkNYC, Intersection has invested in a \xc2\xa0purpose-built fiber optic network for gigabit connectivity.\nThe company also is in talks with the other cities with Link kiosks about rolling out this app to those locations, Levine said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFundamentally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cconnectivity is kind of like the basis of smart city technology. Things need to be connected, people need access to communication, so we think this is a foundational piece of their smart city efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAbout the Author\nMatt Leonard is a former reporter

He was 81.The outpouring of love and respect for the senator began trickling in on Friday, a day before his death, when his family announced he would no longer be treated for brain cancer, which he had been battling for more than a year.New Yorkers joined the chorus of voices to express their sorrow and share what he meant to them.\xe2\x80\x9cHe was truly a gift.

I had the light and was starting to cross when a cab came around the corner and hit me.I was lying in the street, in significant pain and unable to get up. Everyone in the small crowd gathered around me appeared to be calling 911.The ambulance took longer than expected to arrive. A woman crouched down near me.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to sit cross-legged behind you and have you put your head on my lap,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.And then she did just that.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Aug. 27, 2018ImageCreditCreditKelsey WrotenThe New York State primaries \xe2\x80\x94 elections that might help determine the fate of the city\xe2\x80\x99s subways, schools and housing and maybe even Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidency \xe2\x80\x94 are on Thursday, Sept. 13. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, a Thursday.The election was initially scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11, but it was changed amid concerns that the date coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana and the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Primary elections generally suffer from abysmal turnout, but the decision by the Legislature to hold the primaries on a Thursday \xe2\x80\x94 rather than another Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 is likely to confuse voters and to lower turnout further, giving a bigger boost to incumbents. Here are a few ideas to fight back and make these races for governor, attorney general, State Legislature and local judgeships more competitive. Depending on their party registration (and Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one in New York), voters have the chance to weigh in on Democratic, Republican or third-party primaries, and even unaffiliated voters can cast ballots, in the Reform Party primary.Mayor Bill de Blasio could ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts by allocating more money to the New York City Campaign Finance Board, a nonpartisan agency that sends people to knock on doors and call voters.The board might even still have time to place ads in subways and buses. Public service announcements on subways remind riders about train etiquette and to say something if they see something. Why not harness that power to remind New Yorkers to vote?The city could send its 1.1 million public school students home with simple fliers the first week of classes reminding parents about the election. The parks department could print banners to be seen from Flushing Meadows to Marine Park \xe2\x80\x94 much as it did to promote the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s prekindergarten program. The city could put the same message on LinkNYC Wi-Fi kiosks. The state could help, too, by using its digital highway signs. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason the effort should be left to government alone. Small businesses could get in on the push. During the 2016 presidential elections, Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain in Carroll Gardens offered free egg creams to those who displayed an \xe2\x80\x9cI voted\xe2\x80\x9d sticker. What creative efforts to encourage voting could a big company like Starbucks or Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts dream up? We\xe2\x80\x99ll refrain from urging Facebook to play a role, given its track record on elections, but maybe those annoying video screens in yellow and green taxis could pitch participation? Local media has been beating the drum about the Thursday elections for some time. That\xe2\x80\x99s especially true of Spectrum News NY1, where the political director, Bob Hardt, recently posted a delightful video on Twitter explaining why the Sept. 13 primaries are important. The winners of these primary races could determine whether New York enacts fair laws for renters, reforms its criminal justice system and secures the funding desperately needed for its subway system. The winners will have the chance to further undercut Albany\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent-protection racket by making it far easier, at last, to vote in New York. And also at stake is an important effort to change state law to ensure that anyone pardoned by President Trump can be prosecuted for possible state crimes.Many Americans are understandably focusing on the midterm congressional elections in November. But voters in New York should remember to take care of business closer to home first \xe2\x80\x94 and hold the state accountable to the people it represents.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

Image: Getty.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying for it, you\xe2\x80\x99re the product.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase was coined in the 1970s to talk about television advertising, but has since become the internet\xe2\x80\x99s whole business model: we get nice services, for free or for very little, and in return, our attention is sold to advertisers.\nBut what if that logic dominated everyday life? With the rise of the smart city, it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming a reality. And local authorities should be both upfront and cautious about the risks.\nSous les pav\xc3\xa9s, la pub\nIn a time of disappearing budgets, it is understandable that councils will jump at any opportunity to improve their cities without spending a penny. Companies like JCDecaux and Clear Channel provide cities with street furniture such as bus stops and bicycles, in return for advertising space.\nOccasionally, though, the public service aspect is all but forgotten. In 2015, JCDecaux replaced Paris\xe2\x80\x99s 2,000 bus shelters with a new model. With their sleek design, the new shelters had USB ports for charging your phone, and large, digital advertising screens. The only problem? They didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually provide shelter from the rain and had to be changed.\nOther times, public utility is just an excuse for brand promotion, as with the \xe2\x80\x9ctrackable water refill stations\xe2\x80\x9d recently installed in London by Canary Wharf Group \xe2\x80\x93 narcissistic water fountains with a screen that tracks the number of plastic bottles saved.\nWith cities desperate for innovation yet strapped for cash, advertisers have been emboldened to set their own rules. A recent report from the Outdoor Advertising Association of America talks about how the knowledge that a bus passenger is taking a specific route towards a specific destination could be used for hyper-targeted messages: \xe2\x80\x9cThe information might include: an upcoming destination; reminders about previous purchases; points-of-interest along the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis mixing of public and private usages is one way advertisers are cementing their urban domination. As one advertising CEO puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cThe serendipitous confluence of municipal poverty and secular change in marketing practices presents a unique opportunity for a new breed of public-private partnerships.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn reality, \xe2\x80\x9cpublic-private partnerships\xe2\x80\x9d often means public data being used for private ends. The best example of this took place via Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s digital kiosks in New York, the LinkNYC. These kiosks were designed to replace the city\xe2\x80\x99s payphones, and they feature HD screens for accessing maps, services and video calls, a phone, and USB charging ports. The \xe2\x80\x9cLinks\xe2\x80\x9d are owned and operated by the CityBridge consortium, and are funded by advertising on the large screens. Last year, \xe2\x80\x9cInLinks\xe2\x80\x9d launched in the UK.\nIntersection turned public data into private ad dollars last year, when it helped the beer brewing company MillerCoors run an advertising campaign in partnership with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). MillerCoors used MTA data to detect when there were delays on certain train lines, and subsequently relayed this information alongside the slogan, \xe2\x80\x9cYour commute can wait\xe2\x80\x9d and an invitation to stop off for a beer.\nProtecting data in smart cities\nSo where is our personal data in all of that? The future of outdoor advertising lies in the combination of two inherent features of the internet \xe2\x80\x93 free, advertiser-subsidised services, and targeted ads. And the latter means large-scale data collection. As Le Monde reports, the screens that companies like JCDecaux are fitting on public infrastructure \xe2\x80\x9cuse cameras and detection systems to identify with remarkable precision the sex, age, height, weight, and geographical origins of passers-by\xe2\x80\x9d. In some cases, cameras even use \xe2\x80\x9cemotion detection\xe2\x80\x9d, to check if people are responding positively to the message.\nThe marketing possibilities are so enticing that Philippe Baudillon, president of the French branch of Clear Channel Outdoor, just published a book about smart cities, R\xc3\xa9inventer la Street Experience. In his reimagined city, we are all connected, all the time; the street becomes a \xe2\x80\x9creal-life hyperlink\xe2\x80\x9d, sending people towards websites and social media campaigns.\nThe book explains that Clear Channel has also developed a tool called Consumer Audience Smart Tracking, which uses \xe2\x80\x9cmore than 2,000 socio-behavioural criteria taken from anonymised data\xe2\x80\x9d to analyse consumers passing in front of a screen, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking it possible to identify not only the number of people who walk by, but also their lifestyle and consumption habits\xe2\x80\x9d.\nBaudillon stresses that the data is used to identify and target large groups, not individuals: we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about the bus shelter revealing our internet history just yet. Still, with smart street furniture linked to your smartphone\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi, and bourgeoning facial recognition technology, hyper-targeted outdoor advertising is increasingly plausible.\nPublic authorities have, however, shown that they are willing to uphold privacy laws. In 2013, the company Renew London trialled recycling bins which featured LCD advertising screens, and which tracked Wi-Fi signals from pedestrians\xe2\x80\x99 phones. Renew said it collected data from media access control (MAC) addresses simply to measure footfall. But after campaigners raised privacy concerns, the City of London Corporation asked Renew to halt its trial.\nThe French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) denied JCDecaux authorisation to collect similar data. The device would have gathered data from any smartphone users within a 25 radius of their advertising screens, meaning not everybody was likely to have seen the A4 sign notifying them of their rights, according to Osborne Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s marketing law blog.\nThe European Union\xe2\x80\x99s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May, should give citizens even more power in such cases. Businesses are now required to share what kind of information they collect, and individuals must be able to withdraw their consent.\nBut this is much more complicated in a physical, public space than it is online, as the CNIL\xe2\x80\x99s decision recognises. That is why the public should be consulted before projects are finalised. While free technology is always enticing, cities mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget whom they are supposed to serve, before the next big data scandal hits the streets.\nRelated Articles\nEngland needs to close the north-south divide in higher education, too\nCanada\xe2\x80\x99s gay neighbourhoods are struggling.

Eugh. Image: Getty.\nThere are 14 railway terminals in London. That sounds like a lot, even by the standards of London\xe2\x80\x99s 8 million strong population. For context, Beijing has just six terminals between its 21 million people. So if you decide where to live based on the obscure metric of \xe2\x80\x9cnumber of railway terminals per million people\xe2\x80\x9d, London is doing really, really well.\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s such a bother, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Making the inconvenient, interchange-laden journey from Liverpool Street to London Bridge, for example, is the price we pay to travel cross-country; changing in Central London is the norm for many a journey, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive, inefficient, and adds to the footfall at stations that are already stereotypically congested.\nIn fact, as is so often the case, there\xe2\x80\x99s actually a pretty sensible explanation for why London ended up with so many railway stations, even by European standards. As pioneers of the industrial revolution, Britain was the first country to build serious railway infrastructure. But in the hyper-entrepreneurial petit-bourgeois era of early industrialisation, there was no centralised transport system; like Aretha Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s sisters, railway companies were doing it for themselves. (Sorry.)\nBecause London has been the overwhelming economic centre of England since they knocked up the Bayeux Tapestry, all railway services tended to radiate from it. But the great railway boom of the 1830s and \xe2\x80\x9840s predated the arrival of the first underground railway, the Metropolitan Line, in 1863. And the difficulty and expense of demolishing existing suburbs meant that the new railways tended to terminate on the edge of the built up area. The result was separate stations, run by different companies, all around today\xe2\x80\x99s city centre.\nIn any case, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to believe that having all these railway terminals, strewn around London like a contorted hula hoop, is actually a good thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to demonise Birmingham, which is fast outgrowing its ugly duckling stereotype \xe2\x80\x93 but Birmingham New Street serves as a good example of the problem with terminals whose trains go straight through the city.\nThere, the trains run north to south, services reaching both London and Manchester, with easy connections to Moor Street and Snow Hill stations. The choice to run tracks through the station makes the area immediately around it \xe2\x80\x93 in other words, central Birmingham \xe2\x80\x93 less navigable. The interlocking railway infrastructure strangles the city.\nIf the same had happened in London, in the absence of a precarious, hyperbolically ambitious cut-and-cover scheme, we\xe2\x80\x99d lose the precious, contiguous urban core that runs all the way from Paddington to Fenchurch Street.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s another benefit to all these terminals; it means fewer areas end up being cut in half. Urban policy wonks have spent the longest time discussing how arterial roads split communities, but we rarely stop to think about how a railway line could divide one area from another, too. Yes, they're much quieter than, say, the M1, but they're just as hard to cross \xe2\x80\x93 and dividing lines that are mildly problematic in King's Cross Central could've been overwhelming in areas in central London proper.\nThe suburban railways running through outer London are testament to this point. In Islington, the North London Line sharply divides the well-to-do N1 postcode from the more mixed area of N7, and the East Coast Main Line makes the Arsenal Stadium feel miles away even if you live just to the north on Tollington Road, simply because there\xe2\x80\x99s no road crossing for a mile. Imagine if those divides existed in Central London, cutting you off from St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s because you lived on the wrong side of the tracks.\nThe takeaway here might seem obvious: all this infrastructure would be much better off underground. Well yes, it would, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Thameslink and, hopefully, maybe, one day in the far flung future, Crossrail try to achieve, as do London\xe2\x80\x99s subsurface Tube lines.\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that when the Metropolitan and District railways were built, they lay on the urban fringe, which reduced disruption. Thameslink and Crossrail have been fare more costly (and indeed extremely delayed) because they\xe2\x80\x99re now in the midst of a dense urban area. Also, if we wanted to connect, say, Liverpool Street and London Bridge underground, the tunnels would need to skirt around other underground lines. Shy of Brunel\xe2\x80\x99s second coming, this is just too much to ask.\nSo, we should appreciate the ubiquity of railway terminals in London for what they\xe2\x80\x99re worth. Their existence is testament to a tangential, tentative Victorian past where we stumbled through industrialisation, building great railway terminals as we went (and useless Cannon Street too).\nChanging between railway terminals in London is a London experience in itself. At the risk of sounding sentimental, it\xe2\x80\x99s an inconvenience with a history behind it. Unlike Crossrail delays. That stuff is beyond romanticising.\nRelated Articles\nAn official and objective ranking of London\xe2\x80\x99s 14 major rail terminals\nLeeds is still haunted by its pledge to be the \xe2\x80\x9cMotorway City of the Seventies\xe2\x80\x9d\nTransport for London just cut its bus services.

(Intersection Photo)\nFast-growing cities, like Seattle, are looking for opportunities to embrace technology to become more efficient, mobile, and equitable. But working with the private sector to implement innovations can be tricky, as a jammed-up partnership between Seattle and the transit advertising company Intersection proves.\nIntersection is a New York-based company that operates digital ads on public transit and free WiFi information kiosks in London and New York. It is a spinout of Sidewalk Labs, the urban planning-focused sister company of Google under the Alphabet umbrella.\nUntil late last year, Intersection planned to give Seattle bus stops a high-tech makeover and deploy its Link kiosks, miniature billboards that provide free WiFi and other amenities, throughout the urban core. The partnership appeared to be speeding ahead until it hit a roadblock. Now, Seattle \xe2\x80\x9cis not actively negotiating on the proposed electronic kiosks,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office. City officials indicated that privacy concerns are the main reason talks aren\xe2\x80\x99t moving forward.\nIn 2016, the Seattle Department of Transportation told Intersection the company\xe2\x80\x99s bid would be selected for a new \xe2\x80\x9cstreet furniture\xe2\x80\x9d program intended to update bus stops and other amenities on public streets. Intersection says the arrangement would have included \xe2\x80\x9cnew bus shelters and digital kiosks to the city, providing hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors with secure and super-fast Wi-Fi, access to free phone calls, maps, transit updates, and local information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, obtained by The Urbanist, the company offered to pay Seattle between $97 million and $167 million over 20 years in exchange for exclusive rights to operate the kiosks and bus stations. Intersection would have also paid the city a share of the revenue from ads served on the kiosks and bus stops. The ad revenue was estimated to make an additional $100 million or more for the city over 20 years.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of these free services would come at no cost to taxpayers and would generate significant new revenue for the city to invest in transit and other public priorities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jen Hensley, president of Link at Intersection, in a statement to GeekWire.\nIn late 2017, representatives from Intersection shared their plans for Seattle with the regional Chamber of Commerce at a private event. But sometime in the months that followed, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan had a change of heart.\nMayor Durkan had significant concerns with both the privacy and data policies \xe2\x80\x94 specifically what data was collected, how it was stored, what tracking was possible, and how ads were targeted.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the initial proposal, Mayor Durkan had significant concerns with both the privacy and data policies \xe2\x80\x94 specifically what data was collected, how it was stored, what tracking was possible, and how ads were targeted,\xe2\x80\x9d said\xc2\xa0Stephanie Formas, the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s communications director.\nIntersection works with each city to draft bespoke privacy policies for its Link kiosks. All Link devices are equipped with security cameras. In New York, the footage is deleted after seven days, unless it is needed to investigate an incident. Link devices collect email addresses when users log into the WiFi network for the first time but don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for any additional personal information. Intersection does not engage in targeted advertising, according to the company\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy.\nA Link Kiosk (Intersection Image)\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s Link product is a proven solution for expanding access to broadband connectivity, promoting community-based organizations and local businesses, and providing new opportunities for civic engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d Hensley said. \xe2\x80\x9cLink also comes with our strong commitment to user privacy and security.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne of two companies that eventually joined to form Intersection did land in hot water in New York over privacy concerns back in 2014. The company then known as Titan Outdoor\xc2\xa0controlled advertising displays on New York phone booths.\xc2\xa0BuzzFeed discovered\xc2\xa0that the booths contained beacons that could be used to track the movements of passersby and push ads to mobile phones. New York had the beacons removed as a result of BuzzFeed\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.\nIn 2015, Sidewalk Labs bought Titan Outdoors and another company called Control Group, merging them together to form Intersection as an independent startup.\nLast year, Intersection announced\xc2\xa0revised privacy policies\xc2\xa0for LinkNYC after the New York Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the city warning about the company\xe2\x80\x99s data collection practices. Under the revised privacy policy, Intersection stopped collecting information about the websites that users visited when logged into Link free WiFi.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of her background working on privacy issues from decades, Mayor Durkan strongly believes that any proposals using city right-of-way must adequately protect users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy and data and uphold net neutrality principles while ensuring that any such program advances equity for communities throughout Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Formas. \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition, she believes there needs to be a fair return to taxpayers for use of city land and true engagement with the diverse neighborhoods throughout Seattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIntersection\xc2\xa0already operates rail and bus ads in Seattle and the Eastside through partnerships with King County Metro and Sound Transit. Intersection also has an existing office in downtown Seattle.\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear whether the street furniture discussions will be renewed, but Intersection appears optimistic. If the talks start up again, the plan would still require the city to change its sign code to allow ads on public sidewalks.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe look forward to continuing our conversations with city stakeholders about bringing these public benefits to the streets of Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d Hensley said.\nMonica Nickelsburg is GeekWire\xe2\x80\x99s Civic Editor, covering technology-driven solutions to urban challenges and the intersection of tech and politics.

The victims detect the tune, slowed to an unnerving molasses pace, churning from\xe2\x80\x94where is that? The sewer? Or could it be that public WiFi hotspot on the corner? Yes, it calls to them, and just as they connect their phones to the jingling LinkNYC with a glowing USB cord, all goes black. Exactly 24 hours later, authorities find them slashed to ribbons in their apartments, "The World\'s Best" smeared on the wall in melted soft serve.\nThis scenario may sound far-fetched, but it\'s the most likely outcome of the extended Mister Softee mystery/nightmare New Yorkers have been living these past four months. As far as I know, none of the poor souls who\'ve heard the notorious ice cream truck\'s creepy tones floating from LinkNYC kiosks have perished\xe2\x80\x94yet. But the jingle haunting continues, and none of us are safe.\nTwitter user Scott Ethier captured LinkNYC stations near Broadway and 33rd Street in Astoria, Queens on September 2nd cranking out the "slo-mo Mr. Softee" death knell mixed with some very scary air sirens, why the hell not??\n@LinkNYC @Gothamist @BrianLehrer LinkNYC stations around B\'way & 33rd St in Astoria are all playing slow-mo Mr Softee music accompanied by an air raid siren.\n#LinkNYCApocalypse pic.twitter.com/w14Y8YfYe2\xe2\x80\x94 Scott Ethier (@ScottEthier) September 2, 2018\nGothamist has been investigating this creepy mystery since May, when the first strains of Mr. Softee\'s warped jingle drifted from LinkNYC kiosks on Third Avenue in Midtown. Initially, the free WiFi service apologized for inadvertently confusing passersby. "LinkNYC serves New Yorkers in many important ways\xe2\x80\x94providing free wi-fi to more than 4 million users, free phone calls, device charging, and more\xe2\x80\x94but unfortunately, we don\'t serve ice cream," the company said in a statement. "Once we were alerted to the Mr. Softee jingle, we immediately rebooted the tablets to end the song. Sorry if anyone wandered towards the kiosks looking for soft serve!"\nHa ha that was just the beginning: Throughout the summer, reports rolled in from Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, where residents continued to hear the ominous tones blaring from Link stations into July and August. Some speculated that the kiosks, which can harvest user data, may have been hacked. Although LinkNYC attempted to assuage our fears with assurances that this string of jinglings was "just an old-fashioned phone prank," many passersby remain unclear on what, exactly, that means.\nCan you clarify what the phrase "old-fashioned phone prank" means in the context of a public WiFi hotspot/data collection point/tablet-driven advertising monolith? pic.twitter.com/L1SC8gt7ia\xe2\x80\x94 Scott Ethier (@ScottEthier) September 4, 2018\nEXACT SAME QUESTION.\nSpeaking to NY1, LinkNYC explained its reasoning. Someone must be "dialing a number that for some odd reason, plays the jingle, and they leave it on speaker," the company posited. In response to our inquiry into the nature of these alleged old-timey hijinks, a LinkNYC spokesperson acknowledged that not everyone will use the company\'s free services responsibly. Some people will, apparently, call a phone number playing this theme and then leave it blasting from the station\'s speaker after they\'ve fled the scene. LinkNYC has put in place a mechanism that automatically ends calls after 10 minutes if no one taps the screen to confirm their presence. It\'s working to block the offending numbers.\nUnfortunately, though, blocking accounts on any platform often feels like chopping heads of a hydra\xe2\x80\x94which means we\'ll probably be screaming for ice cream for months to come. So please keep us posted on any possessed kiosks you may encounter around the city. Summer may be coming to a close, but this chilling case remains wide open.\n#jingle\n#linknyc\n#mister softee\n#mystery\n#screams\nDo you know the scoop? \xc2\xa0 Comment below or Send us a Tip\nFeatured in Arts & Entertainment\nRead More In:\nNews\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nPopular\nDashed Arrow\nBack to Top\nGothamist\nSend Us a Story Idea\nFollow Us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nGothamist is a website about New York City news, arts and events, and food, brought to you by New York Public Radio.\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nParty Confetti\nDashed Arrow\nSign up for our newsletter!

LEVINE AND JONATHAN WOLFE\nFrom left, Letitia James, Sean Patrick Maloney, Leecia Eve and Zephyr Teachout, the Democratic candidates for attorney general. Holly Pickett for The New York Times\nGood morning.\nThe clock to the primary is ticking: We\xe2\x80\x99re exactly one week out.\nAnd with that, four candidates\xc2\xa0to be\xc2\xa0New York\xe2\x80\x99s next attorney general \xe2\x80\x94 all of whom you\xe2\x80\x99ll see on the ballot\xc2\xa0next Thursday,\xc2\xa0Sept. 13 \xe2\x80\x94 will\xc2\xa0face off\xc2\xa0tonight\xc2\xa0in their\xc2\xa0final\xc2\xa0debate.\nOur Albany bureau chief,\xc2\xa0Jesse McKinley, gave us the rundown of\xc2\xa0what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in the race and why the post is so vital \xe2\x80\x94 particularly now.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe traditional purpose of the attorney general is to defend the state in the legal arena,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McKinley told us. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we\xe2\x80\x99ve crept into modernity, that mandate has broadened with the political ambitions of whoever has held that office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Eliot Spitzer used the power to prosecute cases on Wall Street, for example;\xc2\xa0Eric T. Schneiderman\xc2\xa0opted to\xc2\xa0dig into the activities of President Trump.)\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it can really be a way of investigating almost anything that touches on New York,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McKinley added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever is chosen will have their own viewpoint on what the office is supposed to do and what it can do \xe2\x80\x94 it really is a litmus test as to the interest of the attorney general.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Democratic contenders are\xc2\xa0Letitia James, the New York City public advocate,\xc2\xa0who was endorsed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and is backed by the Democratic Party in New York;\xc2\xa0Zephyr Teachout, a lawyer who was endorsed by\xc2\xa0The New York Times\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Chirlane McCray;\xc2\xa0Sean Patrick Maloney, a congressman from the Hudson Valley; and\xc2\xa0Leecia Eve, a former top aide to Mrs. Clinton and\xc2\xa0Mr. Cuomo.\n(Barbara Underwood, who was appointed attorney general in May after Mr. Schneiderman resigned\xc2\xa0over\xc2\xa0accusations that he physically abused several women, is not running.)\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll really be a test of how powerful insurgent candidates can be,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McKinley said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Tish is the establishment, and no question that Zephyr has run way to the left of her and is banking on progressives, die-hards, \xe2\x80\x98Berniecrats\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 however you want to put it \xe2\x80\x94 coming out in droves to put her over the top.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne shared target, however, is\xc2\xa0Mr.\xc2\xa0Trump. Each of the candidates has\xc2\xa0pledged\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0follow Mr.\xc2\xa0Schneiderman\xe2\x80\x99s lead in taking on\xc2\xa0the Trump\xc2\xa0administration,\xc2\xa0giving\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0New York race\xc2\xa0heightened relevance nationwide.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the legal sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McKinley said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s important because ongoing cases against the Trump administration, and against Donald Trump personally, in some cases mirror and in some cases are ancillary to investigations that are underway on a federal level as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Trump can grant pardons only for federal crimes.\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face the Republican\xc2\xa0candidate,\xc2\xa0Keith Wofford,\xc2\xa0in the Nov. 6\xc2\xa0general election. A victory\xc2\xa0in November\xc2\xa0by Ms. James, Ms. Teachout or Ms. Eve would mark the first time a woman\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0elected to the position.\nTonight\xe2\x80\x99s debate\xc2\xa0at the Cooper Union in the East Village will be moderated by\xc2\xa0Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, and WNYC\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Lehrer.\nThe event is sold out but will be broadcast live on\xc2\xa0WNYC\xc2\xa0(93.9 FM and AM 820) and livestreamed on the Cooper Union\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Facebook page\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0YouTube page, and on\xc2\xa0CAFE.com.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what else is happening:\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the News\nSince pleading guilty last month to federal charges, Michael D.

I heard one member of the family speak.\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to a woman standing near us on the jam-packed subway car. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been growing your nails?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI looked down and saw that the woman she was talking to had nails that were at least six inches long, painted bright gold and curled around in a way that acrylic nails wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed them. Plus, it was a question most New Yorkers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask. We\xe2\x80\x99ve trained ourselves to avert our eyes and mind our own business on the subway.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince 1982,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman with the long nails said with a smile.\nThe first woman returned the smile and complimented her on her nails.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, too,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman with the long nails said.\nI spent the rest of the ride wondering how she had completed some of life\xe2\x80\x99s most basic tasks for the past few decades.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Katie Adrian\nAnd Finally ...\nSidewalk facts.

In 2014, Gothamist reported that New Yorkers have lodged over 7,000 noise complaints since 2010, which averages out to almost five a day, 365 days a year.\nLocalize.city has updated the stats, and found that people may simply be learning to love the jingle (it is less creepy than the LinkNYC version?) and there has been a 20 percent reduction in noise complaints in the last 12 months. There were nearly 1,279 noise complaints about ice cream trucks filed during the last 12 months, through August 15th, 2018. Manhattan had a 47 percent decline in complaints, Brooklyn had a 25 percent decline, the Bronx has a 7 percent decline, while in Queens there was an 11 percent increase in complaints.\nThe areas that had the most complaints include Captain Tilly Park in Jamaica, Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, and the area between Madison Park and Union Square.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause these trucks are mobile, the local hot spots might vary year-to-year, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there remain corridors where residents are persistently annoyed by the song and trying to do something about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Localize.city data analyst Daniel Slutsky said. "For example, last year saw a steep rise in complaints in the north part of Kingsbridge, near Van Cortlandt Park. Not far away though in Norwood, south of the Williamsbridge Oval, there was a drop in complaints compared to previous years. Perhaps, the ice cream truck routes changed \xe2\x80\x94 or the persistent complainers moved away."\nMany complainers, however, remain. As one rapidly unraveling Kingsbridge woman wrote on Facebook in April: \xe2\x80\x9cYOUR A***** DRIVER IS STILL PARKED ON VAN CORTLANDT PARK SOUTH AND BLASTING NOISE. YOU, MISTER SOFTEE, HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.

Credit: Epicgenius, via Wikimedia Commons\nOnly a couple of months after they were installed in 2016, New York City decided to cut off internet access to a series of "smart city" kiosks it built to replace old telephone booths after homeless people monopolized them with such socially unpleasant activities as watching pornography and listening to loud music.\nAccording to a new paper co-authored by Associate Professor of Film & Media Studies Germaine Halegoua, skirmishes like those over LInkNYC "configure how the internet and the city street are and are not public, who is and is not supposed to be using these utilities, and who gets to decide their use." They write that this sort of failure of imagination plagues planners of both the visible parts of the internet infrastructure, like the kiosks, as well as the unseen and publicly unmapped expanses of "dark fiber" backbone network that are buried throughout America.\nIn an article published in June in the journal New Media & Society, Halegoua and her co-author, University of Pennsylvania Assistant Professor Jessa Lingel, write that during the 1990s, when much of the current internet infrastructure was built, network operators overestimated the rate at which demand for connectivity would grow. Thus they laid many thousands of miles of glass fibers in underground conduits that have remained unused, or "unlit," all these years later. That capacity is buried, out of sight and out of the public mind.\nIn contrast, some recent so-called smart-city efforts to distribute internet access through kiosks, wireless and fiber networks strive for visibility and public access.\nThe authors say their study "interrogates the social and material decisions about where networks are, who they are for and how they are accessed." Its title is "Lit up and left dark: Failures of imagination in urban broadband networks."\nFor the portion of the study involving the LinkNYC kiosks, Lingel walked around the three New York City boroughs where they had been installed and asked people what they thought about the kiosks, which the authors liken to "a Swiss Army knife of digital technology support, all free of charge."\nThe authors write that the Links, as they were called, "originally provided four key functions: a USB charger, a Wi-Fi hotspot, phone calls (provided by Vonage) and a web browser."\nLingel asked users who they thought had installed the Links and for what purpose. In fact, LinkNYC was a partnership between the city and companies including Qualcomm and Google.\nHalegoua\'s portion of the study was even trickier to tease out.\n"Maps of dark fiber are generally not available," she said. "That\'s private, corporate information."\nSo Halegoua used grant money from the Urban Communication Foundation and International Communication Association to pay for some of the maps she consulted for the study.\nThat information was compared to the map of LinkNYC kiosks to create a synthesis of the seen and unseen parts of the internet above and below the streets of the city.\nAs for why there is so much dark fiber honeycombing America today, Halegoua blames it, in part, on overbuilding spurred by turn-of-the-millennium exuberance. Like the LinkNYC creators, the builders of the dark-fiber networks failed to consider a wider range of populations living in rural and inner-city regions who would incorporate internet access into their daily lives.\n"It was a failure to imagine future uses and users and also to imagine simultaneous technological developments that disrupted their idea of what a fiber network and public internet access was," she said. "Today, we have other ways of connecting," with smartphones served by satellites and cell towers probably the most relevant.\nWith commercial imperatives having led broadband companies, by and large, to ignore poor communities, "smart cities" looking to improve access "need to expand the imagination of who might use those services and how," Haleguoa said. "If loud music is a problem, you might design the system differently."\nSome cities, including Lawrence, invested in fiber networks that wound up remaining largely dark. Urban planners and communities should try to learn from these histories, Halegoua said, and she hopes her paper can provide "recommendations \xe2\x80\xa6 for policymakers who want to build an urban broadband network that is more equitable or socially just."\nHalegoua is continuing her research on dark-fiber networks, with plans to write a book on the subject next year.\nExplore further\nNYC to pull plug on sidewalk internet after porn complaints\nMore information:\nGermaine R Halegoua et al.

Over 1,600 of these towering, nine-and-a-half-foot monoliths \xe2\x80\x94 their double-sided screens\xc2\xa0festooned with ads and fun facts \xe2\x80\x94 have been installed across the city since early 2016. Mayor Bill de Blasio has celebrated their ability to provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d Anyone can use the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 Android tablets to search for directions and services; they are also equipped with charging stations, 911 buttons, and phones for free domestic calls.\nBut even as the kiosks have provided important services to connect New Yorkers, they\xc2\xa0may\xc2\xa0also\xc2\xa0represent\xc2\xa0a troubling expansion of the city\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance network,\xc2\xa0potentially connecting every borough to a new level of invasive monitoring. Each kiosk has three cameras,\xc2\xa030 sensors, and heightened sight lines for viewing above crowds.\nSince plans for LinkNYC were first unveiled, journalists, residents, and civil liberties experts have raised concerns that\xc2\xa0the internet kiosks might be storing sensitive data about its users and possibly tracking their movements. For the last two years, the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a small but vocal group of activists \xe2\x80\x94 including ReThink LinkNYC, a grassroots anti-surveillance group, and the anonymous Stop LinkNYC coalition \xe2\x80\x94 have highlighted the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s potential to track locations, collect personal information, and fuel mass surveillance.\nNow an undergraduate researcher has discovered indications in LinkNYC code\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 accidentally made public on the internet\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0that LinkNYC may be actively planning to track users\xe2\x80\x99 locations.\nMayor Bill de Blasio speaks at\xc2\xa0a press conference next to\xc2\xa0a LinkNYC public internet\xc2\xa0kiosk on Feb 18, 2016.\nPhoto: Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the Product\nPlans to replace the city\xe2\x80\x99s payphone booth network with Wi-Fi-enabled kiosks were first announced by de Blasio in 2014. Less than a year later, the city awarded a contract to a chameleon-like consortium of private companies known as CityBridge. It was an attractive deal: LinkNYC kiosks, at no cost to the city, would provide free internet coverage to anyone walking by. CityBridge, in turn, would be responsible for the installation, ownership, and construction of the devices, with plans to earn back its expenses through advertising. The twin 55-inch displays will eventually carry targeted ads derived from the information collected about kiosk users.\nThese terms raised alarms among internet researchers and privacy experts, who were quick to point out that nothing in life is truly free. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we know,\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin Dean, a technology policy analyst, told attendees at a New York hacking conference in 2016, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the customer \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re the product.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe key player in CityBridge is known as Intersection, and one of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s largest investors is Sidewalk Labs, with whom it also shares the same offices and staff. Sidewalk Labs CEO Daniel Doctoroff is the chair of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s board. Sidewalk Labs is owned by Google\xe2\x80\x99s holding company, Alphabet Inc. In other words, the\xc2\xa0plan to blanket New York City with 7,500 camera-equipped obelisks has been largely underwritten by the company formerly known as Google \xe2\x80\x94 a corporation whose business model depends on selling your personal information to advertisers. As Doctoroff, who was also the city\xe2\x80\x99s former deputy mayor of economic development, has said of the kiosks: \xe2\x80\x9cBy having access to the browsing activity of people using the Wi-Fi \xe2\x80\x94 all anonymized and aggregated \xe2\x80\x94 we can actually then target ads to people in proximity and then obviously over time, track them through lots of different things, like beacons and location services, as well as their browsing activity. So in effect, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is replicating the digital experience in physical space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union raised multiple concerns with the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s vast and indefinite data retention and the possibilities for unwarranted NYPD surveillance. The NYCLU asked whether environmental sensors and cameras would be hooked up to NYPD systems, including the Domain Awareness System (built by Microsoft). LinkNYC has since updated its policy to state that it will take reasonable efforts to notify users if their information is being shared with law enforcement.\nIn May of this year, Charles Meyers, an undergraduate at New York City College of Technology, came across folders in LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s public library on GitHub, a platform for managing files and software, that appear to raise further questions about location tracking and the platform\xe2\x80\x99s protection of its users\xe2\x80\x99 data. Meyers made copies of the codebases in question \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC Mobile Observation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and shared both folders with The Intercept.\nAccording to Meyers, the \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC Mobile Observation\xe2\x80\x9d code collects the user\xe2\x80\x99s longitude and latitude, as well as the user\xe2\x80\x99s browser type, operating system, device type, device identifiers, and full URL clickstreams (including date and time) and aggregates this information into a database. In Meyers\xe2\x80\x99s view, this code \xe2\x80\x94 along with the functions of the \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d codebase \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that the company is interested in tracking the locations of Wi-Fi users in real time.\xc2\xa0If such code were run on a mobile app or kiosk, he said, the company would be able\xc2\xa0to make advertisements available in real time based on where and who someone was, and that this would constitute a potential violation of the company\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy.\xc2\xa0In 2016, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy made it clear that it did not collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d it states, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know where we provide WiFi services, so when you use the services we can determine your general location.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC disputes these speculations. David Mitchell, Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s chief technology officer, told the Intercept that the code was never intended to be released and was part of a longer-term research and development process. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this instance,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained over email, \xe2\x80\x9cIntersection was prototyping and testing some ideas internally, using employee data only, and mistakenly made source code public on Github. This code is not in use on the LinkNYC network.\xe2\x80\x9d An Intersection spokesperson added that LinkNYC does not collect users\xe2\x80\x99 clickstream data or browsing history, and that it has not used the \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d codebase to collect user data. LinkNYC did not respond to repeated questions about the function or purpose of the code.\nThe Intercept asked four technologists, including a computer forensics investigator and an expert on Wi-Fi location tracking, to independently review the code. Each confirmed that the code could execute commands as Meyers had described, but they emphasized that it was not possible to determine the purpose of the code and whether it was actually running on any kiosks or devices\xc2\xa0based on the information given. They concluded that it was unlikely that\xc2\xa0the code\xc2\xa0was currently in use, as its unfinished security features pointed to the fact that\xc2\xa0it appeared to be in progress, possibly for a mobile product. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it exists, but the fact that it exists is creepy,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Surya Mattu, a research scientist and artist. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way properly to interrogate this further as a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor many researchers and privacy experts, this lack of third party oversight represents the\xc2\xa0most significant issue. Privacy experts told The Intercept that the lack of clarity surrounding LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s leaked code points to the larger lack of transparency surrounding the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s operations. Despite their omnipresence in the city\xe2\x80\x99s major public spaces, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s pervasive data collection is not constrained by any auditing mechanisms, explained Daniel Schwarz, a technology fellow at the NYCLU. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout transparency and external auditing of the source code, as well as what data is collected, for what purpose, and how it is being monetized by the company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no way to verify whether the privacy policy is working to protect users\xe2\x80\x99 data.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA few hours after The Intercept contacted LinkNYC for comment, the company demanded that Github remove Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s copy of its code due to copyright violations.\nPedestrians pass one of the new Wi-Fi kiosks that offer free web surfing, phone calls and a charging station on August 24, 2016 in New York City.\nPhoto: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\nConnecting \xe2\x80\x94 and Controlling \xe2\x80\x94 Communities\nAs LinkNYC expands across the globe \xe2\x80\x94 Intersection has unveiled plans for kiosks in Philadelphia, Toronto, and the U.K. \xe2\x80\x94 so too does the scope of the concerns surrounding it. Shahid Buttar, the EFF\xe2\x80\x99s director of grassroots advocacy, has warned of the possibility of mission creep \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the expansion of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s uses beyond its stated purpose to provide free Wi-Fi. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to presume that a current statement of policy will constrain the consortium of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Buttar said.\nLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s current privacy policy already shows that the company sweeps up enormous amounts of sensitive data\xc2\xa0from all users, such as \xe2\x80\x9cMAC address (anonymized), IP address, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, device type, and device identifiers.\xe2\x80\x9d LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy classifies this information as technical, rather than personal, data.\xc2\xa0It may occasionally \xe2\x80\x9csupplement anonymized Technical Information we collect from you with information collected by third parties. Third parties may include advertising partners or other providers that help us understand our users.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis distinction, privacy experts say, ignores the fact that device identifiers \xe2\x80\x94 even when anonymized \xe2\x80\x94 provide more than enough information to tell advertisers, law enforcement, or malefactors who we are, since most phones and computers are used by the individuals who own them. Knowing\xc2\xa0that a device has been in multiple locations, along with\xc2\xa0the history of the Wi-Fi networks it has visited,\xc2\xa0can provide enough information for someone to find out where individuals live, work, commute, shop, and so on.\xc2\xa0A recent Associated Press investigation found that many Google services for Android devices and iPhones were storing location data even if when users had turned on a privacy setting to prevent Google from doing so.\nAccording to privacy watchdogs, the rollout of the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s cameras have shown how the mission has already expanded beyond its initial purview. In 2016, LinkNYC disclosed that the kiosks \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d contain cameras; by 2017, the cameras were operational. LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy states that cameras do not keep video records for more than seven days and that the camera footage is used to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove the services.\xe2\x80\x9d But opting out is not an option: Just by walking down the block, it is possible to be swept into its audio or video feeds, which can capture a nearly 360-degree view of their surroundings. Civil liberties experts have concerns about the circumstances under which CityBridge will share its ongoing taping with law enforcement. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, according to documents obtained by ReCode, Sidewalk Labs is selling kiosks to other cities that will be able to \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor pedestrian, bike and car traffic, track passing wireless devices, listen to street noise and use the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 built-in video cameras to identify abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s chief innovation officer told MIT Tech Review that it was considering upgrading kiosks to support augmented reality and autonomous vehicles.Join Our NewsletterOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.I\xe2\x80\x99m inThe NYCLU and EFF stated that the ambiguity surrounding Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the code underscores the need for community-driven initiatives to protect the privacy and civil liberties of users. As EFF has noted, there are no means for New Yorkers to participate in decisions about how data from LinkNYC kiosks will be used, with whom they will be shared, for how long they will be retained, or whether the parameters under which they\xc2\xa0are initially collected might expand in the future. In response to Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s findings, ReThink LinkNYC is calling for third-party oversight to confirm that the company\xe2\x80\x99s software does what it says it does.\nThe New York City Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the calls for auditing and stronger oversight. Samir Saini, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT),\xc2\xa0wrote in an email to The Intercept following the publication of the story that \xe2\x80\x9cas a public project, LinkNYC can only exist if it conforms to the City\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous commitment to user privacy. That means the City does not, and will never, allow the network operator \xe2\x80\x94 CityBridge \xe2\x80\x94 to exploit individual identifiers or precise location of LinkNYC users. If, at any time during our careful oversight of CityBridge, we discover practices that violate the Privacy Policy, we will direct CityBridge to immediately cease and desist from that practice. It is unfortunate that CityBridge inadvertently posted code on Github for an R&D project they were working on. CityBridge is not permitted to use code that tracks the precise location of users on the LinkNYC network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a follow-up email to The Intercept, Saini explained that city\xe2\x80\x99s audits will be \xe2\x80\x9ctriggered when DoITT feels that an investigation of specific franchisee practices is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0At present there are no regular audits of the CityBridge agreement to determine whether LinkNYC is violating users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s being held to its standards because there is so much opacity and not enough transparency surrounding the system,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Buttar. \xe2\x80\x9cThere needs to be some designated processes with public accountability and participation before the kiosk system and private organizations that constitute the consortium can propose changes unilaterally on millions of users.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCorrection: September 18, 2018\nThis article has been updated with comments from Samir Saini, commissioner\xc2\xa0of the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, who contacted The Intercept after publication. Saini clarified the LinkNYC privacy policy and explained that CityBridge does not retain the right to collect information about the specific websites users visit on their own devices.\nUpdate: September 10, 2018\nCharles Meyers filed a counter notice with Github, challenging LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s takedown demand, and he has made the code he found available again here.We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

After a string of early campaign gaffes \xe2\x80\x94 a surrogate referring to his challenger Cynthia Nixon as an \xe2\x80\x9cunqualified lesbian\xe2\x80\x9d and a bizarre remark about how Jews lack rhythm, among other things \xe2\x80\x94 Gov. Andrew Cuomo seemed to be finding his stride in the final weeks leading up to Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic primary election. Past polling has shown him winning handily, and a new Siena poll out this morning shows him beating Nixon by a 41-point margin. Then came the last 72 hours.Gov. Andrew Cuomo insisted Friday there was nothing political about his decision to hold a massive campaign-style event, and to invite Hillary Clinton, for the opening of the new Mario Cuomo bridge a week before the primary. By Friday night, it appeared that announcement was too hasty: the new span was closed again, after contractors working on the bridge realized the old Tappan Zee Bridge could collapse and endanger its new counterpart. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s opponents accused him of risking lives for the sake of having the bridge opening as a campaign backdrop. Hours later, reporters and politicians were learning about a mailer insinuating Cynthia Nixon is \xe2\x80\x9canti-semitic\xe2\x80\x9d being sent to voters by the State Democratic Party; among other things, it raised new questions about why the party is targeting a specific primary opponent before its members have had a chance to vote.Adopting a tactic he has used to distance himself from the troubled subway system that he runs, Cuomo tried to absolve himself of responsibility in both cases: Cuomo insisted that the State Democratic Party, which he effectively controls, sent out the Nixon mailer to thousands of homes without his approval. (Never mind the fact he\xe2\x80\x99s used the party as a vessel for his political ambitions since he took office 8 years ago.) And at a press conference he convened Sunday, he denied responsibility for the Tappan Zee Bridge problems.. "I have no authority in this situation," he said Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not our bridge\xe2\x80\x9d...When the Second Avenue Subway opened last year, the governor poured champagne at its inaugural ride. Months later, he said that the state had no control over the subway system. On Friday, he drove FDR\'s car over the new span of the bridge he\'d pushed to be renamed after his own late father. But when government showed its cracks, literally, the buck stopped somewhere else.IT\xe2\x80\x99S MONDAY. L\xe2\x80\x99Shanah Tovah. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ...

Step Two: Get photographed taking the train. Step Three: Tweet out the photo (or rely on passers-by to do same). Would-be governor Cynthia Nixon does straphanger photo-ops. Council Speaker Corey Johnson does them, too. So occasionally does avowed motorist Mayor Bill de Blasio. Across the Hudson, Gov. Phil Murphy does it, on the foundering NJ Transit. In fact, perhaps the only major local politician who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it is the one who controls New York\xe2\x80\x99s crisis-ridden subway system. That would be Gov. Andrew Cuomo. It\'s not like his advisers haven\'t tried to persuade him to give it a try. They\'ve urged Cuomo, who is running for a third term, to ride the subway on more than one occasion, according to two knowledgeable sources. The governor has demurred. One explanation has it that the image of a \xe2\x80\x9cpassive straphanger\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\'t align with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s can-do persona. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enable him to don a windbreaker or grapple with machinery alongside predictably deferential transit workers.

Andrew Cuomo, hinting that taking sides against the governor could have negative consequences for the city he governs. De Blasio, who for weeks has declined to publicly weigh in on the race now only days away, said in a statement he would keep his vote private in order to protect his relationship with whoever wins the Democratic primary. The mayor and governor have been in a years-long feud of unknown origin, but Nixon has intimated in recent weeks that she did not anticipate de Blasio\'s backing, citing the governor\'s penchant for retribution.

Is it a hack or an "old-fashioned phone prank"? A guerrilla commentary on the invasive nature of these data-siphoning obelisks that seem to be sprouting from the pavement each day? Or just another ice cream scam? Is it weird that we\'re hungry and frightened at the same time?\nSome answers to our questions remain elusive, but others are beginning to snap into focus. Over the weekend, tipster Jason Eppink encountered one of the singing kiosks at 35th Avenue and 37th Street in Astoria, and managed to jot down a phone number from the tablet\'s screen.\nApparently, someone\xe2\x80\x94something?\xe2\x80\x94is using the public WiFi hotspots to dial an answering machine in Iowa, which is, or at least was, connected to a recording of the latest version of the slowed-down jingle. That number is 563-999-1308, and up until last night, you could call it and hear an even stranger variant on the soundscape. In this iteration, the slowed-down ice cream jingle is remixed with some cryptic mutterings\xe2\x80\x94"There are 47 airplanes in the underground hospital, airplane #17 is performing stomach surgery on airplane #7," followed by a string of numbers.\nWe don\'t know, either, but go ahead and listen for yourselves:\nEppink\xe2\x80\x94who has his own history of public pranks, but swears he\'s not the culprit\xe2\x80\x94says he heard the dramatic song on both Saturday and Sunday this past weekend. He noted the active call had been going on for about 5 minutes (the calls are programmed to time out after 10 minutes), and says he\'s unsure whether it\'s "the original provocateur or someone building on their success."\nThe latest remix comes after some New Yorkers noticed the creepy theme song accompanied by an air raid siren in Astoria earlier this month.\n@LinkNYC @Gothamist @BrianLehrer LinkNYC stations around B\'way & 33rd St in Astoria are all playing slow-mo Mr Softee music accompanied by an air raid siren.\n#LinkNYCApocalypse pic.twitter.com/w14Y8YfYe2\xe2\x80\x94 Scott Ethier (@ScottEthier) September 2, 2018\nThe first slowed-down jingles\xe2\x80\x94sans air horns or hypnotic airplane mumblings\xe2\x80\x94were first heard in May of this year, and have since been spotted all over the city. There\'s also another LinkNYC kiosk in Astoria that, according to Eppink, has been known to play a call-in show focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

For too long, these networks have been locked into old technology, and agencies have not had the budget to innovate. Current systems are delivering a poor experience \xe2\x80\x93 for both end users and IT teams \xe2\x80\x93 and prevent new technologies from enabling agency missions.\nWhile government IT has stagnated, private-sector IT has raced forward, roughly doubling performance and capacity every five years. Technology giants such as Google and Amazon have leveraged new technologies to unlock gigantic value and productivity, creating new consumer experiences. They have dramatically raised expectations of what IT can accomplish and how it should be provided.\nWireless is the new network onramp for accomplishing the mission. Industry partners with both traditional Ethernet and wireless expertise can provide government agencies with an IT infrastructure on par with the leading tech giants of today. This will enable agencies to meet modernization goals and improve the IT experience for both internal and external users.\nThe time to upgrade is now, because the government wireless onramp needs a lot of repair. Two recent polls conducted by The Government Business Council highlight the need for immediate action.\nThe first survey asked government employees about the state of their agency\xe2\x80\x99s wireless or Wi-Fi networks. The results were sobering:\n50 percent rated their work network poor or very poor.\n63 percent said that their workday wireless experience was worse than what they encounter elsewhere.\n49 percent said the poor wireless experience hindered their productivity in fulfilling the mission.\nThe results from the second poll highlight employee dissatisfaction with current policies and the poor user experience relating to federal wireless networks:\nOnly 23 percent of respondents were satisfied with their agency\xe2\x80\x99s bring-your-own-device policy.\n22 percent were not allowed to use their personal devices at all, and 40 percent of those that can reported having to jump through onerous IT policy hoops.\nOver 61 percent felt that security concerns trump and interfere with workplace efficiency.\nNew wireless technology allows agencies to meet these challenges in a far more efficient and economical way. Wireless local-area networks have made dramatic leaps in performance over the past few years. And a better end-user experience is just the beginning of the benefits. Performance can be enhanced while improving security and lightening the load on the IT department.\nNewer software-as-a-service platforms make certificate-based solutions easier to implement as front ends to existing Network Access Control (NAC) solutions, enabling new customization features that reduce administrative overhead and complexity. These new certificate solutions are agnostic -- they can integrate into any network and can be deployed via the cloud or on-premises. Users register their devices one time, and from then on, connectivity is seamless.\xc2\xa0 Certificates are fully customizable to the specific workflow of the agency, and the IT team retains granular policy control over data access.\nCertificates leverage a public key infrastructure, a well-established method for the secure transfer of electronic information. Email clients, servers and smartphones have PKI support built in, and multiple certificate sources can be accommodated. Wireless network connections are protected with WPA-2 Enterprise, while also mitigating WPA-2\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to KRACK attacks. And many of the new solutions are much less expensive because they are priced per user not per device, which is the current pricing model for government NAC solutions.\nWith new technology, cities and bases can be made \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d via wireless networks with a speed and efficiency unheard of just a few years ago, even in environments traditionally inhospitable to wireless connectivity, like inside steel buildings or across rural communities. These smart systems are advanced and future-proofed, ready to evolve and deliver whatever performance the towns need moving forward.\nWhen updating a wireless government network, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that the network of the future requires a heterogeneous environment. Agencies must ensure that they work with best-of-breed partners for all elements of their network -- especially the edge. With technology advancing so quickly, agencies should not put all their IT eggs in one contractor\xe2\x80\x99s basket.\nAgencies can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to ask employees to accept an inferior user experience every time they log in at work. Specific smart city initiatives such as New York City\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC have demonstrated a better way forward, with clearly established best practices. By leveraging the latest technology, agencies can improve the user experience, simplify management and reduce costs.\nMuch like many of our country\xe2\x80\x99s roads and bridges, the government wireless onramp is in desperate need of maintenance. The good news is the right technology can give agencies a wireless network worthy to the mission, both quickly and economically.\nAbout the Author\nChris "CT" Thomas is senior systems engineer with

The ecommerce platform for buying, financing and selling used cars has now launched as-soon-as-next-day vehicle delivery in the Big Apple.To celebrate entering its largest market to date, Carvana is maximizing its marketing presence in Manhattan with a one-day integrated campaign today (September 20) to tell New Yorkers about the company\xe2\x80\x99s way of buying a car. Carvana will actually parade its services through New York with a caravan of five signature Carvana car haulers carrying vehicles. Partnering with a production artist, Carvana designed three car-sized takeout bags for NYC-style delivery, emphasizing that you can now order a car online and have it delivered to your doorstep. The parade will cross the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn and tour through the city, passing signature areas like SoHo, Columbus Circle, Midtown and Washington Square Park.Throughout the day, more than 250 digital on-street LinkNYC units will display Carvana advertising along the parade route, as well as a live social feed of those using the campaign hashtag #TheNYCWayToBuyACar. Those who spot the parade are encouraged to snap a photo and post to their social handles using the hashtags #TheNYCWayToBuyACar and #sweepstakes for a chance to win a year of free Postmates (up to $5,000).\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City is the largest market we\xe2\x80\x99ve launched to date, so it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting we give it our largest celebration\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernie Garcia, founder and chief executive of Carvana. \xe2\x80\x9cNew Yorkers are known for being mobile-first, so we\xe2\x80\x99re proud to be the first to give them a fully start-to-finish mobile car buying experience; a service they\xe2\x80\x99ve become accustomed to for much of their purchasing decisions.\xe2\x80\x9dCarvana now offers as-soon-as-next-day vehicle delivery in nearly 80 markets across the US. Carvana customers shop for and purchase their next vehicle entirely online, saving a trip to the dealer along with time and money. Along with high-definition, 360-degree photos, every Carvana vehicle comes with a seven-day return policy so the customer has time to ensure the vehicle fits their life.\nCustomers can shop more than 10,000 vehicles on Carvana.com, finance, purchase, and even sell their current vehicle to Carvana, then schedule as-soon-as-next-day delivery to their home or office in as little as 10 minutes.Building campaigns from the insideCarvana was founded in the digital age, in 2012 in Phoenix, with a mission to change the way people buy cars. They also changed the way auto sales marketing is done, pulling their creative teams in house to make for a vertically integrated experience, from campaign ideation to the final sale.Paul Keister, Carvana\xe2\x80\x99s chief creative officer, was a former agency creative, and executive director at his agency, Goodness Mfg, when he started working with the upstart Carvana. After working on his first project with the company and Carvana\xe2\x80\x99s co-founder and chief brand officer, Ryan Keeton, they knew it was a good fit and Keister came over to run the in-house team.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re vertically integrated, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a decision to build versus buy to be able to control that whole chain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keeton. \xe2\x80\x9cWe outsource a small amount of things here or there \xe2\x80\x93 PR, and media planning and buying, we work with Horizon Media. Everything else, from social, creative to design to digital marketing, to quantitative analytics\xe2\x80\xa6 people with PhDs in astrophysics building out models for our marketing \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s all in house. We made that choice because we believe you\xe2\x80\x99re able to focus really deeply. We needed to build the capability ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9dThe in-house agency covers roughly 30 people in Phoenix and in Venice, California. Being internal means that the creatives can spend their time focusing on brand solutions and producing new creative, rather than pitching new business.\xe2\x80\x9cWe take the best of what makes an agency tick and focus there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keister, adding that they make identify the business priority, then write a brief. After that, they find the \xe2\x80\x9cideas we like, flesh them out, build them, make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting the key objectives, and produce them. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more streamlined (than agencies). We still provide hearty discussions and checks and balances with each other.\xe2\x80\x9dNot Carvana\xe2\x80\x99s first stuntThe campaigns at Carvana started with one that still has legs, one that started when Keister was at Goodness, called the Wavy Guy.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the story of the lovable Wavy character at the dealership that has been silent witness to all the things that have happened over time. He gets fed up when he punches the clock and goes home (to his Wavy family) and decides to use Carvana. That helped get traction. Wavy Guy was effective to our growth. That single campaign has had a long shelf live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keeton.\nHe added that television has been an effective advertising medium for the company, due to its national reach. Other campaigns have included \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t Play the Game\xe2\x80\x99 where people had to play ridiculous dealer games only to lose money, and a New Way to Buy a Car Smell, which spoofed cologne commercials by adding silly ingredients, including a \xe2\x80\x9csingle tear of a car salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSocial media has helped grow the company as well, and one of the main catalysts for that is the life-sized Carvana car vending machine.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the key performance indicators, the ultimate one is someone buying a car. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had customers directly reference that vending machine experience as their first point of contact with Carvana. That shows it was provocative enough for them to learn more about us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keister.\nCarvana vending machine\nAdded Keeton: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an asset that we developed to use in markets to build awareness. We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it on tours. Not only is it a physical element, it\xe2\x80\x99s got an interactivity to it. People love taking a picture using it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that those pics are often shared on social media.The two added that the car business is a noisy one, and they use their marketing tactics to show people that Carvana is a very different way to buy.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not a marketplace. With us you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with the hassle of dealers, of a salesperson. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have overhead. Once folks start to understand and dig in\xe2\x80\xa6 doing it all from home makes a big difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keeton.\nCarvana Car Delivery\nAdded 20 September 2018\nOverall Rating\n5/5\nVote\nThis article is about: North America, Automotive, Advertising, Creative, Marketing, BrandShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare to FacebookGet The Drum NewsletterBuild your marketing knowledge by choosing from daily news bulletins or a weekly special.RelatedOpen MicRecommended ReportsFrom our Network\nThe Drum articles suggested by\nHelping publishers increase engagement, improve monetization and drive new audiences.\nRead moreMore Must WatchOn The SceneTalking HeadsDrum DocumentariesEverything You Need To KnowFuture Stars Of DigitalBrand LoveVideoThe CMO Swap: Britvic x TribeVideoRosie Arnold looks back on her career and explains why she never wanted to start her own agencyVideoFearless Girl statue disappears from New York's streetsVideoEverything you need to know: Programmatic 2.0 The value of the middle pathVideoIs this the era of social media reckoning?

Factor in a GPS misfire, a flat tire or even an unexpectedly long meeting, and the situation is amplified significantly. During the past year, a few new options have floated across my radar for fighting this dilemma with as little frustration as possible. Following are my favorite strategies for keeping battery woes at bay.Combos: Carrying a separate battery backup and charging cable to keep your phone topped off can be a real drag when you are already running short of space in your gear bag. Finding a spot to plug in both devices along with your laptop at a crowded airport gate can be a frustrating feat as well. Recently, my husband and I discovered the existence of battery cases for our smartphones.Since the battery is located inside the protective case you place on your mobile anyway, you receive additional functionality out of an item you were already using. No extra storage space necessary. There's also no extra charging cord required since using the same attachment port you would normally use to charge your phone through your phone case charges both items at once. For less than $20 a pop, we ordered one for each of us and never looked back. We receive more than double the charge time and our equipment takes up as little space as possible. Ours are from a company called Accerzone, which makes cases to fit our particular phones, but prices are comparable for equivalent products to suit other models.\nSize: As with the cases mentioned above, the size of any piece of technical travel equipment is of specific concern. Bulky gear is always a bore, but portable battery rechargers can be exceptionally frustrating when it comes to finding luggage room. This is why my husband and I were so excited to find a miniature one by Nuon on the Batteries Plus website recently. Previously, we always switched between regular and rechargeable batteries whenever we transitioned between fast-paced travel to stationary periods where we slow down to work on more time-consuming projects. For 30 bucks, we now have a space-efficient option for recharging the batteries we use most often on the road for things such as specialized astronomy binoculars and red light headlamps.Another go-to piece of charging equipment for our household is a world power travel adapter by Targus. While the $20 price we paid was certainly right for our budget, what we really love most about it is the fact it all fits in a compact tube shape that's easy to pack. So many similar products can be enormous by comparison, and make working while abroad more frustrating than it needs to be, particularly on days when we need to change locations with all of our bags in tow. We've been using this power adapter for several years now, and it continues to work seamlessly whenever we need it.Infrastructure: Any digital nomad who routinely uses fast food establishments and bookstore coffee shops to crank out some work between highway stops can attest to one highly inconvenient truth. Free Wi-Fi doesn't necessarily mean free electrical access to go with it. For those living out of a carry-on bag with limited space, one multi-plug adapter and a single extension cord will only get you so far, particularly if you need to go for long stretches of time between traditional charging options. In addition to in-flight power ports and more charging stations showing up at airports these days, some interesting new options are starting to show up in major cities.LinkNYC, for example, offers power charging and internet access at free-to-use kiosks throughout the Big Apple. Visitors needing to charge their mobile device can do so via a USB port connected only to power for security purposes, while still accessing the internet via a touch screen and keypad for free calls and information searching as they wait to power up. Residents and tourists alike can utilize these free stations as they search out eateries, transportation, polling locations and more. The kiosks even have ports to plug in your headphones so you can have privacy for any calls you need to make while you await a full charge. These same types of kiosks are also available throughout the U.K. in England, Wales and Scotland. Similar devices are coming soon to both Philly and Newark, N.J.Making your life work from the road can be challenging, but not impossible. With a few precision product purchases, planned access to infrastructure and a commitment to pay attention to power-hogging background apps, you can remain as charged as necessary for most situations.\nWhat's your reaction?\nLove\n0\nFunny\n0\nWow\n0\nSad\n0\nAngry\n0\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nSave\nTags\nCharging\nElectricity\nElectrotechnics\nPhone\nKiosk\nDeadline\nDevice\nBattery\nExtension Cord\nMore Headlines\nIn the Kansas town that was home, the astonishing story of Eisenhower lives on\nWhat to do when you lose your passport overseas\nA wine country weekend close to home: Southwest Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s vineyards boast variety \xe2\x80\x94 and a cute new B&B\nCruise lines give refunds for some Cuba cruises on first day of US ban\nMultimedia\nPhotos: Rochester FC, FC Minneapolis soccer\nPhotos: International Yoga Day on Peace Plaza\nPhotos: Honkers, Bismarck baseball\nPhotos: Safe City Nights at George W.

New Yorkers, she said, have been very receptive.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy now, New Yorkers have understood it\xe2\x80\x99s important what you put into your bodies and how you treat them . . . I think the natural extension of that is laundry and home care products that you need to take a closer look at as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe environmental component of our business has always been very important . . . In the end it\xe2\x80\x99s up to all of us. It needs to start somewhere, and the smallest entity is the individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCelsious is one of several city businesses highlighting ways to lower environmental impacts in time for Climate Week NYC\xe2\x80\x99s kickoff on Monday. And in celebration of the summit\xe2\x80\x99s 10th year, organizers are encouraging New Yorkers to make both small and large changes to live more sustainably with their #10things campaign.\nThere are more than 150 events planned during the summit, including discussions, museum tours and documentary screenings.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think one of the reasons why Climate Week NYC is so important is because it brings together some of the most influential people from business and government, alongside those who make up one of the largest cities in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen Clarkson, CEO of The Climate Group, said in an emailed statement. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom cutting down on plastic, to reducing our reliance on fossil fuel powered vehicles, Climate Week NYC is proving to be a powerful force to encourage those in positions of power to do the right thing, so that we can all make the personal choices needed to tackle climate change.\xe2\x80\x9d\nChanges can include turning off water while brushing your teeth, eating a more plant-based diet and eliminating single-use plastic.\nRestaurateur Ravi DeRossi owns several vegan restaurants participating in Climate Week, including Avant Garden, and said factory farming is having a hugely negative impact on the planet.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur consumption of meat, the way we eat is completely changing the world and it\xe2\x80\x99s awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody in the world is seeing that more vegan restaurants are popping up right and left . . . Right now, every day counts because don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time left. Fortunately, people are waking up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeRossi said he has also removed plastic straws from his restaurants, instead opting for things such as paper or bamboo straws. He\xe2\x80\x99s exploring other alternatives as well.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have that attitude of \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m just one person using one straw a day.\xe2\x80\x99 Its hard to imagine that one person can make a difference, but its true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf everybody works together and thinks as a whole as opposed to individual we can have an impact massively.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJeff LaPadula, who co-owns participating vegan eateries P.S. Kichen and Terri, said choosing vegan or vegetarian food makes a direct impact on climate change.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor us, we really want people to realize that climate change and helping the environment really begins with each person,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt all kind of begins with us, with your knife and fork . . . A little drip of water can start a flood, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor travelers, things like bringing your own water bottle or choosing public transportation are easy changes, suggested Fred Dixon, the president and CEO of NYC & Company, which has promoted the Climate Week NYC campaign through bus shelters, LinkNYC, social media, and in taxis. He added it\xe2\x80\x99s also more important than ever to highlight the city\xe2\x80\x99s environmentally friendly attributes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York itself is quite a green city already in many ways, compared to other cities,\xe2\x80\x9d Dixon said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know going forward as a destination, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to be seen to be taking the climate change issue seriously. It\xe2\x80\x99s about just igniting new conversations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy Alison Fox alison.fox@amny.com\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nComments\nWe're revamping our Comments section.

Three of the haulers carried vehicles inside giant takeout delivery bags to highlight its new delivery option. They included a "receipt"\xc2\xa0attached to the back that read, "Buy your car online and get it delivered. Just like everything else in New York."\nMore than 250 digital on-street LinkNYC displays featured Carvana ads and a live feed of people using the campaign hashtag #TheNYCWayToBuyACar. People who saw the parade of vehicles were encouraged to take photos and post them on social media using the campaign hashtag and #sweepstakes for a chance to win a year of free Postmates up to $5,000.\nDive Insight:\nCarvana\'s\xc2\xa0interactive campaign could help the company reach younger consumers as it enters its biggest market to date.\xc2\xa0Parading cars wrapped in takeout bags around New York City was an attention-grabber, and also provided opportunities to engage with social media-savvy generations. Encouraging passersby to snap, post and hashtag photos \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0which in turn were placed on large digital displays \xe2\x80\x94 might have helped boost social media traffic for the brand. .\nMarketers continue to invest in out-of-home (OOH) marketing \xe2\x80\x94 like Carvana\'s\xc2\xa0use of LinkNYC\xc2\xa0displays \xe2\x80\x94 to drive awareness and reach consumers in unique ways at key points throughout their busy day-to-day lives. Brands that dedicate 15% or more of their media budgets to OOH had a 24% increase in brand trust, 106% increase in perception of brand quality and a 275% increase in customer loyalty, according to a recent survey by Rapport, IPG Mediabrands\' OOH division.\nIf successful, the campaign could help automakers reach a demographic that has been less inclined than older generations to buy cars. While consumers generally want to purchase vehicles online, many millennials in particular do not even want to own their own cars. In addition, Gen Z\'s conversations around auto brands have also dropped off significantly, as most prefer walkable areas and ride-hailing services, a recent Engagement Labs study\xc2\xa0found.\nRecommended Reading:\nMarketing Dive\nOut-of-home ads can boost customer loyalty by 275%, study finds\nMarketing Dive\nGen Zers drop destination retail, auto brands from the conversation, study finds\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nCreative\nSocial Media\nTop image credit:\nCarvana\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Marketing Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nMarketing Dive\nTopics covered: social media, mobile, advertising, marketing tech, content marketing, and more.\nDaily\nview sample\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

The plan was to spend $200 million installing as many as 10,000 kiosks, or Links, that would supply free, encrypted gigabit Wi-Fi to passers-by within 150 feet. They would have buttons that link directly to 911 and New York\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service and free USB charging stations for smartphones, plus wired handsets that would allow free calls to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. And perhaps best of all, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the city a dime; advertising would subsidize expansion and ongoing maintenance.\nThe\xc2\xa0Links wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just get urbanites\xc2\xa0online and let them juice their phones, though. The idea was to engage users, too, principally with twin 55-inch high-definition displays and tethered Android tablets with map functions. Mike Gamaroff, head of innovation at Kinetic, characterized the Links in 2016 as \xe2\x80\x9cfirst and foremost a utility for the people of the city, that also doubles up as an advertising network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTwo years after the deployment of prototypical kiosks in Manhattan, Intersection \xe2\x80\x94 a part of the aforementioned CityBridge, which with Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes manages the kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 is ready to declare them a success. The roughly 1,600 Links recently hit three milestones: 1 billion sessions, 5 million users, and 500,000 phone calls a month.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an opportunity to communicate with people as they navigate their day,\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection senior consumer marketing manager Amanda Giddon told VentureBeat in a phone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mandate is to help make Link a part of the community through content and content strategy \xe2\x80\x94 really, anything that [makes] New Yorkers feel like tourists in their own city [or] even help tourists feel like New Yorkers through useful, actionable information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCreative content\nAt any given time, the Link kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 screens host news headlines from the Associated Press, comics, weather info, real-time alerts from the Office of Emergency Management, and creative from a mix of roughly 50 other campaigns. Also on tap are hundreds of hyperlocal factoids\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis Day in New York\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about people (\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Hildebrandt opened the United States\xe2\x80\x99 first tattoo business in New York City in 1870\xe2\x80\x9d), places (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a superhero supply store in Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x9d), and things (\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City gets 15 times more snow than the South Pole each year\xe2\x80\x9d). There are close to 400 trivia tidbits in all, with new ones joining the collection each week.\nGibbon researches the facts herself, typically spending a few hours a week\xc2\xa0poring through a range of sources, including Broadway.org, Grow NYC, Time Magazine, FiveThirtyEight, and the\xc2\xa0National History Museum. She dutifully fact-checks them and copies them to a master spreadsheet before deciding which ones will make the cut.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been really great to see people writing in about the content they see.\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve created some moments of awe for people, and if I can create a moment of awe for someone on a daily basis, then I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my job right,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Giddon said.\nWhen the kiosks aren\xe2\x80\x99t alerting pedestrians to, say, the percentage of New Yorkers riding elevators at any time, they display real-time bus arrivals and local maps. But the bulk of their programming consists of rotating regular, seasonal, and limited-time content collaborations with organizations, publications, and government agencies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe survey our users quite frequently [for ideas] \xe2\x80\xa6 and we go to great lengths to make sure our [content] is contextually relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giddon. \xe2\x80\x9c[We\xe2\x80\x99re] pioneering this publishing approach and public space and are really eager to get feedback and adjust as we continue to expand.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne recent example is a partnership with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) that showcased the work of local artists. Another is \xe2\x80\x9cPopular Places Near You,\xe2\x80\x9d a Foursquare-powered feature that shows top restaurants and entertainment hubs within walking distance.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the tip of the iceberg. Intersection worked with the Museum of the City of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Beyond Suffrage exhibit to feature NYC women in politics, with the NYC Department of Records to curate historical photography (localized at a neighborhood level), and with Silicon Harlem and Global Kids to showcase legendary\xc2\xa0African Americans\xc2\xa0during Black History Month.\nSocial services\nIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0also leveraging the kiosks to promote civic engagement.\nIn April, it teamed up with the New York City Council to roll out Participatory Budgeting New York City, which let residents as young as 11 vote via the kiosk tablets on how the city will allocate its $40 million public budget. And it launched an awareness campaign to get New Yorkers registered to vote in advance of the November 2018 general elections. (The latter integrated with the city\xe2\x80\x99s voter registration data to show a real-time count of the number of people signed up.) It also posts Community Board meeting notices and local road closures and through its LinkLocal program lets small businesses advertise for free on select kiosks around the city.\nIntersection has experimented with social services, too. In January, users were able to browse and enroll in health plans through New York State of Health insurance marketplace.\nFor some New Yorkers, the Link hubs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a convenience \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re a lifeline. A 2014 study by the Office of the New York City Comptroller found that 27 percent of NYC residents surveyed \xe2\x80\x94 40 percent of whom had less than a high school education \xe2\x80\x94 lacked broadband internet at home.\nWithout a reliable internet connection, students can\xe2\x80\x99t access online classroom resources, out-of-work adults can\xe2\x80\x99t submit job applications, and families struggling to make ends meet can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of social services. As the New York Times wrote in August 2016:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn urban areas, rural areas, and everywhere in between, students who lack internet service at home have difficulty doing their nightly schoolwork. Many of them cobble together whatever connectivity they can, picking up free Wi-Fi signals in front of libraries, in school parking lots, and at fast-food restaurants.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFour years ago, De Blasio\xc2\xa0touted the Links as a sign of progress in the fight for unimpeded internet access. \xe2\x80\x9c[They\xe2\x80\x99re] the fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[and] a critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d\nControversy\nBut the accolades tend to ignore the fact that LinkNYC isn\xe2\x80\x99t strictly a philanthropic effort. Advertisements that run alongside Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s programming were expected to generate between $500 million and a billion dollars over the next 12 years. (CityBridge and the city split the ad revenue equally.)\nAnd the kiosks themselves aren\xe2\x80\x99t without controversy.\nThe connected tablets initially had an internet browser, but Intersection disabled it in response to complaints about users browsing pornographic material. It also added vision-assistance tools after the National Federation of the Blind sued the City of New York and LinkNYC, arguing that the tablets lacked basic accessibility features.\nRevenue, meanwhile, has missed expectations.\xc2\xa0Over the first two years, the city collected $43.4 million in payments, narrowly beating the $42.5 million minimum CityBridge guaranteed. Under an amended deal, CityBridge will delay paying the city its share of revenues (above the minimum payments) until the last year of the contract, when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be due with 10 percent interest.\nAnd as The Intercept recently pointed out, consumer advocacy groups and activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Stop LinkNYC, and ReThink LinkNYC, have brought attention to the hubs\xe2\x80\x99 potential for mass surveillance.\nEach hub is equipped with three cameras and sensors capable of, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor[ing] pedestrian, bike, and car traffic; track[ing] passing wireless devices; listen[ing] to street noise; and \xe2\x80\xa6 identify[ing] abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNone of this has scared away investors, who extended $150 million in financing to Intersection last year.\nIntersection makes clear in its privacy policy that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. And in response to recent allegations that it intends to track Wi-Fi users\xe2\x80\x99 real-time positions, it said it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0collect their clickstream data or browsing history.\nAs Intersection and CityBridge eye expansion to new markets, Giddon said, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take into account feedback they\xe2\x80\x99ve received so far.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be a combination of lessons learned and ensuring we add a little local flavor [to our programing],\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe have research teams in New York and Philadelphia who\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted some preliminary focus group testing to understand how to best serve the community. We\xe2\x80\x99re really open to feedback, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work here and look forward to seeing how it\xe2\x80\x99s received.\nIntersection hopes to install 7,500 Link kiosks by 2026, when its contract with the city expires. In June, it launched InLinkUK, a partnership with telecom provider BT and outdoor advertising agency Primesight to replace over 1,000 pay phones in major U.K. cities with kiosks. In September, 100 kiosks\xc2\xa0hit the sidewalks of Philadelphia as part of its LinkPHL program. And by the end of this year, 45 will come to Newark.", b"New York City's Wi-Fi kiosks have over 5 million users - PhoneArena\nLog in\nMenu\nHome\nNews\nReviews\nPhone finder\nSpecs comparison\nSize comparison\nCamera comparison\nBest phones\nBenchmarks\nCarriers\nVerizon\nAT&T\nT-Mobile\nSprint\nU.S. Cellular\nView all\nBrands\nApple\nSamsung\nGoogle\nLG\nMotorola\nSony\nHuawei\nView all\nHome\nNews\nReviews\nPhone finder\nSpecs comparison\nSize comparison\nCamera comparison\nBest phones\nBenchmarks\nTools\nSpecs comparison\nSize comparison\nCamera comparison\nBest phones\nBenchmarks\nLog in\nCarriers:\nVerizon\nAT&T\nT-Mobile\nSprint\nU.S. Cellular\nsearch\nBrands:\nApple\nSamsung\nGoogle\nLG\nMotorola\nSony\nHuawei\nHome\nNews\nYou are here\nWireless service\nNew York City's Wi-Fi kiosks have over 5 million users\nby\nAlan Friedman\n/\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sep 30, 2018,\n8:52 PM\nBack in 2014, we told you about New York City's plans to get rid of 10,000 pay phones that were still dotting the Big Apple's landscape. The plan was to replace the pay phones with\xc2\xa0 Wi-Fi kiosks that would offer free Wi-Fi at speeds up to 1Gbps, and include charging stations and an Android tablet. And ads would be sold to help fund the project, eventually making it self-sufficient.\nNearly four years later, there are 1,700 kiosks in the five boroughs, and more than five million people are registered to access the free Wi-Fi connectivity, with 20 million Wi-Fi sessions taking place each week, along with 500,000 free phone calls. Because each LinkNYC kiosk uses fiber optics, it provides data speeds up to 100 times faster that public Wi-Fi. Each kiosk can support hundreds of Wi-Fi users simultaneously, standing within 150 feet of the unit.Through the tablet on the kiosk, those in the city can make free phone calls to anywhere in the U.S., including calls to 311,411 or 911. International calls can be placed with the use of a calling card. And in case users do need to call 911, each kiosk features a red button that can be pressed to call for emergency help. Since navigating the city can be difficult, the tablet can also provide maps and directions to users. Each LinkNYC kiosk is equipped with two free USB charging ports. And both are connected to a power supply only, so the data stored by a mobile device is safe and sound.The LinkNYC kiosks are built to withstand just about anything that can happen in New York outside of King Kong terrorizing the city. They are protected from the elements, flooding, earthquakes, vandalism and theft. They also are equipped with multiple cameras and sensors that can monitor foot, bike, and car traffic. Eack kiosk can also track passing mobile phones and tablets, listen to street noise and identify packages left by individuals.While it all sounds great, there have been some issues. The browser on the tablet had to be disabled because the kiosks originally attracted porn-starved New Yorkers without their own internet connection. And ad revenue has fallen short of estimates. This has forced the consortium behind the project to delay paying New York City its 50% share of ad revenue until the last year of the contract, which is in 2026. 10% interest will be added. By then, the plan is to have 7,500 LinkNYC kiosks up and running.\nFeatures available on the LinkNYC kiosksource: LinkNYC via VentureBeat\nFEATURED VIDEO\nOptions\n4\nComments\nReply\nReport\n1.\nFerneyZan\nPosts: 113; Member since: Jul 21, 2010\nInteresting for sure..\nThis is something that should be in the plans for other cities as well, not just NYC..\nposted on Sep 30, 2018,\n9:21 PM\n2\nReply\nReport\n2.\ngamehead unregistered\nI don't believe I ever used one of these\nposted on Sep 30, 2018, 10:31 PM\n0\nReply\nReport\n3.\nrsiders\nPosts: 1889; Member since: Nov 17, 2011\nI'm not one of those conspiracy theorist types but I do believe in too much technology and potential privacy risks.

Quite a few, in fact. The LinkNYC team has revealed that there were over 5 million registered WiFi users as of September 2018, with over a billion sessions spread across the 1,700-plus units in the city. People make over 500,000 calls every month, too, although it's not clear how many of those were ice cream truck pranksters. You can safely presume that there's plenty of demand.\nAs VentureBeat reported, though, these kiosks haven't been without their share of concerns. They're ad-subsidized, but they've barely earned enough to meet the CityBridge consortium's minimum guarantee. The group also removed the kiosks' web browsers after complains of people surfing porn sites or hogging the machines. There's also the concerns about privacy given the presences of cameras and sensors on every kiosk, although Intersection (a part of CityBridge) has stressed that it doesn't collect sensitive info like exact locations or browser history.The kiosks are likely to have a long life, as Intersection's LinkNYC contract lasts until 2026. Whether or not they continue to see healthy adoption is another story. Now that mobile 5G is on the horizon, many New Yorkers could have gigabit-class (or at least, close enough) speeds in their pockets within the next few years. They'll likely have their uses, particularly for visitors, but they might not be as alluring as personal internet access catches up.\nVia:\nVentureBeat\nSource:\nLinkNYC\nIn this article:\ncitybridge,\ngear,\ninternet,\nkiosk,\nlinknyc,\nnewyorkcity,\nwi-fi,\nwifi\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Thousands upon thousands of visitors and residents of the city walk past these screens, using them for everything from public Wi-Fi access to charging devices to getting info about city services.\nThis September, however, users of the more than 1,700 active LinkNYC kiosks throughout the city might have noticed something new on the screens: brightly colored blue and yellow features, almost like testimonials for open data. These testimonials are simple, featuring the faces of real people, their job titles or affiliations, and a quick list of what they accomplished with open data as well as the data sets they used.\nFor example, one screen says: \xe2\x80\x9cRentlogic, Yale Fox\xe2\x80\xa6 I used NYC OpenData to bring transparency to the rental market. Data used: open HPD violations, DOB violations, DOB ECB Violations.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of Fox, and a second note, reading: \xe2\x80\x9cI am an entrepreneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Simple, clear, easy to read and understand.\nRELATEDDesigners Are Driving Culture Change in City HallWhat Is Human-Centric Design?The Importance of Celebrating Data WinsOther featured stories include civic technologists who used New York open data to bring more transparency to community projects, a data scientist who used it to predict the lifespan of New York street trees and an environmental planner who showed how the city\xe2\x80\x99s sewer system works among others.\nCraig Campbell, a special advisor to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Data Analytics \xe2\x80\x94 which is the primary municipal agency behind the city\xe2\x80\x99s open data work \xe2\x80\x94 recently spoke with Government Technology about this storytelling campaign.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to give people a sense of what is possible using open data,\xe2\x80\x9d Campbell explained. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone need not use open data, but everyone should have the opportunity to use open data. This storytelling campaign is designed to get the word out about the resources that exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo date, New York City has published more than 2,000 data sets, with an ongoing release of more. This has led to more than a million users accessing New York City open data, many of whom create projects like the ones described above.\nThis storytelling effort in New York City dates back years, spanning more than just the vignettes on the kiosks. The local government\xe2\x80\x99s open data efforts, however, date back even further. In 2012, the city passed a law requiring an annual open data report available to the public that outlines information such as what data has been released, or which sets are running behind schedule. Essentially, the report details all aspects of what the city government is doing to comply with its open data law.\nIn the past two years, part of the focus of that report, Campbell said, has become to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the data seem more real by telling real stories about the people behind the data.\xe2\x80\x9d This effort has taken a wide range of forms, from videos to updates on the city\xe2\x80\x99s open data portal. Campbell also noted the work in its current form would not be possible without Reboot Inc., a design firm with which the city has partnered, or the work of Al Webber, the city\xe2\x80\x99s director of open data.\nAnd New York City is far from alone in its use of such storytelling to share its municipal tech and innovation work. This discipline has become a priority for jurisdictions across the country, with many of the foremost experts in the field preaching the value of celebrating data wins.\nEssentially, the public needs to understand what data is available, why it matters and how it\xe2\x80\x99s being used \xe2\x80\x94 both within local government and by civic tech groups \xe2\x80\x94 to improve quality of life, if open data is to become a valued and important part of our society moving forward. Detroit has even gone so far as to create a position in its city hall for a chief storyteller. Meanwhile, many city halls across the country are turning to design philosophies to bolster efficiency and help create human-centered products that are easy to access and use for constituents.\nSo, while these bright screens on New York City kiosks may be novel now, odds are good that this project \xe2\x80\x94 or others like it \xe2\x80\x94 will spread rapidly. Campbell described it as a way to \xe2\x80\x9copen up the hood, pull back the curtain\xe2\x80\x9d on not only the logistics but also the importance of open data work in municipal government.\nZack Quaintance\nAssistant News Editor\nZack Quaintance is the assistant news editor for Government Technology.

That effort will include a Global Cyber Center, an innovation hub for startups, initiatives to fuel commercialization and research, and new cybersecurity talent pipelines.\nAiming to address the cybersecurity needs of New York\'s signature industries -- finance, healthcare, retail and media \xe2\x80\x93 Cyber NYC also plans "catalyze" the growth of 10,000 cybersecurity jobs over the next decade, according to NYCEDC officials.\nCyber NYC is powered by a $30 million city investment and will leverage up to an additional $70 million from private funding from companies including Goldman Sachs, PricewaterhouseCoopers, MasterCard and Facebook.\nThe initiative includes the following efforts:\nA 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Center will offer a cyber range, a virtual testing ground to run simulations and coworking space for startups. \xc2\xa0Developed by Israeli corporate innovation expert SOSA, the center will also offer structured programming for companies and industry-specific events to encourage investments, commercialization and implementation of cyber technologies in NYC\xe2\x80\x99s leading corporations.\nNYCEDC tapped international venture capital firm Jerusalem Venture Partners to establish Hub.NYC, an \xc2\xa0international cybersecurity investment hub to support growth-stage startups and facilitate their access to clients. It will also offer business support and investment, with the objective of growing startups into major, NYC-based cybersecurity firms.\nColumbia University\'s Inventors to Founders program will connect academic cybersecurity researchers with experienced entrepreneurial talent to commercialize the technology and launch new cybersecurity companies through mentorship, training and validation capital.\nFor the Applied Learning Initiative, the City University of New York, New York University, Columbia, Cornell Tech, and iQ4, a cloud-based virtual collaboration platform provider, will build a cyber talent pipeline. The partners will offer city residents certification and degree programs and provide degree-seeking students with real-world, case-method education about cybersecurity and facilitate job placements.\nFullstack Academy, a software development school, and CUNY\xe2\x80\x99s LaGuardia Community College will develop a Cyber Boot Camp to prepare New Yorkers for cybersecurity jobs.\n"Today\'s cybersecurity environment is more intricate and complex than ever before, and presents itself to companies, organizations and individuals alike," said Sean Joyce, cybersecurity and privacy leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the Cyber NYC partners. "To combat this ever-evolving threat landscape, it\'s important that we invest in developing skilled professionals, innovative approaches, and build collaboration across the public and private sector to thwart potential attacks and build stronger resiliency."\nMobile cybersecurity for city residents\nTo help NYC residents better protect themselves from mobile cyber threats, the NYC Cyber Command launched a free app that alerts mobile users to threats on their iOS or Android devices or on the Wi-Fi networks they are accessing.\nThe New York City-funded NYC Secure mobile app warns users about threats on their mobile devices, such as unsafe apps, a potentially unsecure Wi-Fi network or unsafe settings and activity. It can detect elevation-of-privileges attacks, rogue access points, and unenabled encryption.\xc2\xa0 After identifying potential issues, NYC Secure offers recommendations on how to address the threats. The app does not require an internet connection to detect a threat, so alerts are immediate.\nNeither the city nor the app\'s developer, Zimperium, collect or use any personal information.\nThe app was first announced in March as a part of Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s larger NYC Secure initiative, aimed at protecting New Yorkers online that also included securing the city\'s public Wi-Fi networks. \xc2\xa0The Quad9 automated security platform the city deployed blocks access to known malicious sites by checking IP addresses against IBM X-Force threat intelligence, which includes daily monitoring of \xc2\xa0more than 40 billion web pages and images and 17 million spam and phishing attacks.\nNYC Cyber Command mandated the deployment of the technology on the city\'s internal networks by the end of 2018. It will also be deployed on the LinkNYC network, whose 1,400 kiosks offer free high-speed Wi-Fi around the city\'s five boroughs.\nAbout the Author\nSusan Miller is executive editor at GCN.\nOver a career spent in tech media, Miller has worked in editorial, print production and online, starting on the copy desk at IDG\xe2\x80\x99s ComputerWorld, moving to print production for Federal Computer Week and later helping launch websites and email newsletter delivery for FCW.

The fashion for smart city pilot tests has finished. The technology works, we are told. The last challenge is how to pay for them, when so many of their benefits are hard to calculate financially.\nHow do you make money from sensors in car parks, really? How much, exactly, is information about air pollution worth?\nIn a new report, Navigant Research has looked at the smart city market, and identified the five key funding models that have started to make it tick. Here, we consider each, as means to solve 21 century urban challenges, and ask obliquely if any of them will bring intelligence to cities, beyond just a few noisy outliers\n1 | PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPs / 3Ps)\nA public-private partnership, declined as PPP in Europe and 3P / P3 in North America, is a cooperative arrangement between two or more public and private sector entities, where the financial risk is loaded on one side of the deal, typically towards private enterprise.\nPPP / 3P deals have been employed as a standard financing instrument by governments across the globe, particularly as a way to fund major public infrastructure projects during the last 30 years. The structure of the model, and the allocation of risk, varies considerably, depending on partners and applications.\nIn the smart cities space, it is the most common and, as yet, most effective tool for governments and suppliers to push forward with their projects. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all over the place, in many smart-city application areas, and they come in many different flavours,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ryan Citron, senior research analyst at Navigant Research.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is essentially just a contract between a public authority and private supplier that defines a way to work together, but the definition is pretty loose.\xe2\x80\x9d The financial risk is largely assumed by the private sector, he notes, so tax payers \xe2\x80\x9caren\xe2\x80\x99t on the hook\xe2\x80\x9d if something goes wrong.\nIn smart city deployments in the US, the financial burden assumed by the private sector has been greater, simply as state funding has been less. In Europe, most smart city projects have retained a stream of funding from the European Union, typically via its Horizon 2020 programme, pushing research and innovation in the region through to 2020.\nThe upside for the private sector is the chance to secure major regional and national infrastructure deals, only with the sting of bank-rolling such projects through their formative years. Key incentives are built into PPP / 3P deals by governments in order to justify the investment for the private sector.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernments typically guarantees some level of service, or offers subsidies, grants or tax breaks,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Citron.\nPPP / 3P arrangements have helped many smart city technologies take root. However, they require a clear business case with a reliable return-on-investment. The problem for the smart city movement, and vendors pushing novel solutions in the space, is so many of the applications and use cases are either completely untested, or else they only offer a kind of \xe2\x80\x98soft\xe2\x80\x99 ROI.\nIn the end, the financial risk for both sides is too high. \xe2\x80\x9cFor many smart-city applications, the return is less clear for investors,\xe2\x80\x9d comments Citron.\n2 | ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS (ESPCs),\nAs discussed above, PPP / 3P models are hugely varied; at one extreme, they effectively result \xe2\x80\x98energy savings performance contracts\xe2\x80\x99 (ESPCs), where the financial incentives are effectively swapped for a share of the energy savings achieved by the tech upgrade.\nIn the smart city space, ESPCs have become the default tool for getting smart buildings and smart street-lighting projects off the ground. The model works so buildings are retro-fitted with energy control and management systems, and whole cities are afforded brand new lighting infrastructure, without making any capital investment.\nInstead, they relinquish their energy savings until the supplier recovers their own costs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt uses the future energy savings to fund the investment. Once the energy savings pay off the initial fee, the city starts to reap the benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Citron.\nFor street lighting, vendors reckon cities can save 70 per cent of their energy and maintenance costs by combing connected LED lights and control systems, and make the money back in a few years.\nCitron explains: \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of companies are telling cities they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay anything. They\xe2\x80\x99re saying: \xe2\x80\x99Your paying $10 million per year in electricity costs for lighting; put our system in and save $7 million. You can have it paid off in three years, and save a tonne of money every year after that.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe ESPC model has effectively made street-lighting the poster child for smart city applications. Cities like the model, too, because the supplier is the one penalised if targets are not met, removing risk almost completely.\nBut, like with PPP / 3P master deals, ESPCs work because the ROI is well understood. The energy savings from other smart city applications \xe2\x80\x93 including even popular point solutions, like connected waste bins, weather sensors, and parking systems \xe2\x80\x93 are murkier, and riskier for investors.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge with all of these models is how to apply them to other smart city applications,\xe2\x80\x9d says Citron.\n3 | AS-A-SERVICE OFFERINGS (aaS)\nSubscription-based models offer another way for cities to avoid making upfront payments for tech infrastructure and service offerings. They appear to cities rather like ESPCs, insofar as the cost is spread over a set period. The difference is the outcome for the city is not written into the bargain at the start.\nTypically it is attached to more conventional service offerings, rather than infrastructure projects. Certain lighting companies, for example, require cities to pay a subscription to make use of their control and management functions. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good model \xe2\x80\x93 the city doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay upfront; just on an ongoing basis. It makes it easier to bear,\xe2\x80\x9d says Citron.\nIncreasingly, smart city providers are aspiring to get their capital costs down to the point they can also offer as-a-service schemes. Street parking, says Citron, has been expensively rolled out in cities like Los Angeles, with every single space fitted with a sensor to create a parking map for drivers.\nBut the sheer cost of such an exercise has stopped cities from copying, and suppliers from pushing. Instead, they are seeking to redesign their tech and rewrite their algorithms to make the service more affordable, if also more approximate, and to eke out a subscription model for partners,\nDespite increasing interest and adoption, however, as-a-service models are hard to offer when material costs are high in the first place. The five models are discussed here are less popular, by degrees, as we go through them. Subscription based offerings have found less traction than standard PPP / 3P models or energy savings contracts. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not very common, at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCitron explains: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard in some realms for companies to come in and provide the service without charging upfront for some of the tech.\xe2\x80\x9d\n4 | INVESTMENT RECOVERY THROUGH ADVERTISING / MARKETING\nFrom here, we are scraping the barrel. The idea cities and enterprises will be able to monetise the data gathered on their city streets remains just that \xe2\x80\x93 an idea, locked in pilot mode in most cases. The idea an open data platform, in a smart-city control centre, will spark a new economy of local innovators is appealing, but hard to grasp.\nEither way, these more expansive smart city concepts invariably hinge on the a hard ROI, probably realised by upgrading the street lights. Most experiments in the market only exist because the business case for street lights is so clear.\nThere is one alternative, however; the well-trailed LinkNYC project in the US, which is seeking to convert 7,500 old pay-phone booths across the five boroughs of New York City into digital kiosks. The plan was to spend $200 million. City Hall did not have to pay a dime. The cost \xe2\x80\x93 and then some \xe2\x80\x93 would be recovered through advertising, to the tune of $500 million over 12 years. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s paying for the project,\xe2\x80\x9d says Citron.\nAround 1,600 kiosks are in operation, offering free, fast and secure (gigabit) Wi-Fi to passers-by, push-button connections to emergency services, free USB charging, tethered Android handsets for free calls, and touchscreen access to city info and services. Five million people have stepped into the kiosks so far, reckons CityBridge, the consortium behind the project.\nThe payback for the city is connectivity and accessibility. The model has been picked up by electric vehicle (EV) charging companies, too, notes Citron, offering advertising space on their charging stations to be able to make a return and offer free charging.\n5 | SOCIAL IMPACT BONDS (SIBs)\nA recent phenomenon, social impact bonds (SIBs), also known as pay-for-with the pay-out contingent on agreed social outcomes. Issued by the public sector and funded by private sector, while they operate over a fixed period of time, they do not offer a fixed rate of return.\nThe first social impact bond was announced by the UK government in 2010 to finance a prisoner rehabilitation programme, bringing together innovators to generate idea to develop social action. In a smart-city context, it has been used here and there for healthcare projects, and other applications related to the criminal justice system\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting model. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been used much. The contracting arrangements can be kind of complex, and difficult to finance. But it really targets social oriented investors, and people interested in alternative measures of financial performance,\xe2\x80\x9d comments Citron.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a major model, but it\xe2\x80\x99s innovative and a little different \xe2\x80\x93 and it does focus on improved social outcomes, which is really the goal of most smart city projects. It could be used in transportation a bit more, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis article is a forerunner to a report and webinar, titled How to buy / sell a smart city \xe2\x80\x93 procurement models to make every city smart, to be published on November 5.

Public-private partnerships can help bridge the gap. State and local governments increasingly are looking to leverage the agility of the private sector through creative affiliations, while also trimming the cost of innovative projects.\nThree examples help to show how PPPs can help civic officials get to a desired IT endpoint faster and more effectively.\nLink NYC Rolls Out Free Wi-Fi Kiosks in New York City\nNow in the fourth year of a projected 12-year rollout, Link NYC aims to install more than 7,500 free public Wi-Fi kiosks. The effort brings together the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and CityBridge, a consortium of IT firms including Intersection, Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe third-party franchisee, CityBridge, was in a position to provide cutting-edge expertise in selling advertising, as well as the ability to build out the private network,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrew Manshel, assistant commissioner of franchise administration\xc2\xa0for the New York City IT department.\nMore to the point, the franchisee and the tech partners bear the cost of the project. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to use the limited capital funds that the city has available in order to do this,\xe2\x80\x9d Manshel says.\nWith 1,800 kiosks already installed, Manshel says the secret to a successful PPP lies in both sides understanding their respective roles. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city steers and the private-sector partner rows,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means we set the high standards for the partner to meet, and they execute on those standards. We went in with clear standards for these kiosks, both aesthetic and technological.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMORE FROM STATETECH: Find out why these eight smart cities are ones to watch!\nKentucky Residents Breathe Easier with AIR Louisville\nThe city of Louisville, Ky., has a reputation for lousy air quality, with a high incidence of asthma and respiratory distress. With help from a private tech supplier and funding from a national nonprofit, a city-led PPP is looking to change that.\nWith $750,000 in funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, medical device maker Propeller Health supplies \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d asthma inhalers that correlate to location, building a localized database of air quality and health risk. The Institute for Healthy Air, Water and Soil, part of the University of Louisville, helps to analyze the data, with an eye toward identifying high-risk locations and trends around the city.\nIt took city-sized muscle to bring all the players together. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the power of working in the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office. We could take people who were normally in different silos, all these disparate players, and present them with this shared problem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Grace Simrall, Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s chief of civic innovation and technology.\nA PPP also offered a unique vehicle for solving a civic problem without spending tax revenues on untried technologies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs an innovation office, we are looking for true breakthroughs, which often means using brand-new methods and brand-new data sources. Given that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to experiment using the public dollar,\xe2\x80\x9d Simrall says.\nAt the same time, the PPP brought to the table a level of experience the city couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have accessed in-house. \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment should not be expected to have core competencies in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Simrall says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have emerging technologies, we need to rely on private partners. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to develop a smart medical device when there are companies out there who have done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMORE FROM STATETECH: Get practical IT governance advice from former smart city leaders!\nCommuters Travel Smart with Water Street Tampa\nIn Tampa, Fla., Smart Mobility Manager Vik Bhide would like to leverage the expanding Internet of Things to deliver smart traffic lights, enhanced signage and maybe even autonomous vehicles.\nHe sees the emerging Water Street Tampa development as an opportunity to do all that. The city is partnering with developer Strategic Property Partners on the $2 billion to $3 billion project, which has backing from Bill Gates\xe2\x80\x99s Cascade Investment. The city also is teaming with the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority to help execute a $21 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to study connected vehicle technology.\nThe partners all come together via the recently formed Tampa Bay Smart Cities Alliance.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith smart cities, most solutions delivered to the end user pass through several entities, and it helps to have a place where these entities can coordinate with one another,\xe2\x80\x9d Bhide says. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving an alliance that incorporates most of these entities \xe2\x80\x94 the city, the utilities, the major developers \xe2\x80\x94 allows us to streamline services and to bring new solutions to market sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs envisioned, Water Street will have 9 million square feet of hotel space, along with 3,500 residential units, 1 million square feet of cultural and retail space, and 2 million square feet of office space in 18 different buildings.\nUltimately, Bhide describes the PPP as the logical expression of the interconnected realities underlying smart city technology. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason we need the partnerships is because the end user straddles everybody\xe2\x80\x99s business in consuming these newer smart-city services,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe partnership creates a circular value proposition, using public infrastructure and private data to deliver a better service.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC/Twitter\nMore On\nInnovation\nInvestment\nIT Governance\nReturn on Investment\nInternet of Things\nSmart Cities\nWi-Fi\nRelated Articles\nNetworking\nNew Atlanta CIO Advisory Board Can Elevate Residents\xe2\x80\x99 Concerns, Experts Say\nNetworking\nSmart Cities Fuel Traffic Light Boom to Gather Congestion Data\nNetworking\nHow 5G Networks Will Benefit State and Local Agencies\nOct\n08\n2018\nSponsors\nLatest Articles\nSmart Cities Council Winners Ready for the Future\nLos Angeles Wants Tech to Liberate Police Officers from Administration\nGeorgia Telemedicine Initiative Bolsters Health in Rural Areas\nHow State and Local Agencies Can Turn to Self-Scanning Tools for Cybersecurity\nNetworking\nRisk vs. Reward with Internet of Things Deployments\nData Center\nDisaster-Ready State and City IT Systems Weather the Storm\nAdvertisement\nTrending Now\nDispatch Centers Upgrade 911 Systems in the Face of Cyberthreats\n3 Benefits of Effective Government Cloud Management\nSmart Cities 3.0: 5G, Edge Computing and Citizen Engagement\nHow to Help Your Local Agency Block Malware That Can Cause Data Breaches\nRegister\nStateTech\nTechnology Solutions That Drive Government\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nSite Map\nStateTech:\nCDW:\nVisit Some Of Our Other Technology Websites:\nBizTech\nEdTech\nFedTech\nHealthTech\nExperts Who Get IT\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Next for Smart City IoT?

Same thing about registering for health coverage through the NY State of Health via LinkNYC. It is physically impossible to upload proof of income and ID and the like from a LinkNYC tablet, but headlines make it look like all kinds of New Yorkers are doing this when no one possibly can.ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

The deadline in New York is this Friday, Oct. 12, for both online and in-person registration.\nFrom Democrats, Republicans, progressives and conservatives, every angle of the political spectrum is scrambling to make sure eligible voters are registered to flood the polls. In the wake of the recent confirmation of now Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, all sides are energizing their bases for victories in November.\nOne example is in an email sent out Wednesday by the New York Progressive Action Political Action Committee urging citizens with the message \xe2\x80\x9cDemocracy is dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur message to you today is simple and clear,\xe2\x80\x9d the email said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur democracy is in a state of peril. Any unregistered person who does not register to vote by Friday will be silenced by the powers that be Nov. 6.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NAACP unveiled a strategy to maximize the Black vote by targeting low and moderate propensity voters. The civil rights organization worked with GSSA, LLC, a Colorado data analytics group and partner in the initiative, to map out metrics for the Black community to have an impact on the elections and identify parity in registration and turnout of Black voters in battleground states.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to become a potent political force, the Black community must build a political infrastructure that will vote in both presidential and non-presidential elections and at all levels of the ballot,\xe2\x80\x9d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all eligible members of the community rise to the challenge and vote, we control the fate and future of our community. Stated more directly, we must vote in far greater numbers because our lives, our very existence depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NAACP is also enlisting the support and partnership of members and of allied organizations, including the faith community, Pan-Hellenic organizations and issue-advocacy groups. So far, more than two dozen memoranda of understanding have been executed with partner organizations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the current social, political and policy environment, change will only happen in our democracy through voting our interests and our conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Black community can only improve its political and economic situation in America by becoming a potent political force.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis week in the city, reminders were all around along city streets as LinkNYC kiosks flashed messages about registering to vote along with a countdown clock to Friday. Information was also flashed about the number of voters in particular districts.\nHowever, even those who feel confident they are registered are being urged to double-check before the Oct. 12 deadline. The New York Civil Liberties Union reports that many showed up during the September primary only to find out their names were missing from voter rolls. Among those missing from the roll was Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s own son, Dante.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe suffer from confusing registration deadlines and outmoded poll books that cause errors, delays, and long lines,\xe2\x80\x9d the NYCLU said in statement. \xe2\x80\x9cTo make matters worse, due to decades of partisan gerrymandering, New Yorkers cannot be sure they receive equal representation even when they cast their ballots.\xe2\x80\x9d\nVoters are being urged to check their status by going to voterlookup.elections.ny.gov, where they can enter their name, date of birth, county and ZIP code. If no match is found or the voter\xe2\x80\x99s status is not listed as active, the voter should contact the Board of Elections.\nAt the end of September on National Voter Registration Day, more than 800,000 eligible voters updated their registration or registering for the first time. The registration drive surpassed the previous record of 771,321 set during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nAlso of interest\nYour vote...voices of wisdom\nStill fighting for voters\'

It had grown accustomed to making money by licensing call box operators and taking a share of their income, but mobile phones were becoming popular. And payphones were going bust.\nThe City authority instructed phone booth operators to sell advertising space on their call boxes and give it a share of that revenue, too.\nIt earned $26m that way in 2000. In the following decade, as 75 per cent of payphones in the US were scrapped, NYC kept its payphone income near $20m. A decade on, its ad income started going up, while its income from phone calls fell to near zero, and half again of all payphones in New York were scrapped.\nNYC decided it was time to reinvent the payphone, to make it more of an advertising hoarding with a phone attached. And that is how the next-generation phone kiosk was born. The City would make $500m from call box adverts over the 12-year life of its next licence contract, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in 2014, shortly before awarding it to a consortium that dreamed up a next-gen phone kiosk called LinkNYC.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all about money, though. LinkNYC had been patched together from a medley of visionary designs submitted to a public competition the City held to \xe2\x80\x9creinvent the payphone\xe2\x80\x9d in 2013. It embodied the public ethos as well, and ideas NYC had been pushing for around decade: a comms kiosk with a touchscreen web interface and local guides and services. Competition concept drawings imagined 10ft digital panels displaying not ads but sci-fi info-schematics.\nHurricane Sandy clinched the deal in October 2012, shortly after NYC officials defined how the payphone should be reinvented, and ahead of the last payphone contracts reaching the end of their 15-year terms. The old ones had been defamed, since it seemed no-one but vagrants used them anymore. Then Sandy knocked out all but the public phone network and people turned to payphones in their emergency. The reinvented ones would be free, high-speed wireless internet beacons as well, with emergency buttons. And, as de Blasio put it, all at no cost to taxpayers.\nNYC could cover the cost with advertising and still take a larger cut. It cited a deal where it allowed a billboard firm to put adverts on municipal street furniture and took half the income. The phone deal it did in 1999 had got a\xc2\xa0third, and just a dime in every dollar spent on calls.\nNYC told potential suppliers in 2012 what a next-gen phone kiosk should be: a slim panel like other street ad hoardings. Switching these with chunky phone boxes, NYC would declutter its streets, make them look smarter, and ease pedestrian flow.\nThis contrivance of public and private purpose was reflected in the consortium of companies that formed to produce the LinkNYC kiosk. At their heart was Intersection, a corporation formed from the merger of Titan, the largest US billboard operator, and Control Group, a tech studio that had designed public information kiosks for the New York subway. A sister of ad-funded tech giant Google put up money. Qualcomm, the comms equipment maker, along with other tech firms, contributed specialisms.\nIt was the same kiosk they brought to BT in the UK in 2017. But the business model was not the same at all. Public authorities didn\xe2\x80\x99t control phone boxes in the UK, so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any money out of them. Many have consequently opposed the scheme.\nBT had taken call fees from the UK\xe2\x80\x99s classic red phone boxes when it was the national telecoms operator in the latter part of the last century, retaining the right after it was privatised in 1984. Laws held that phone boxes were a public good, so BT should ensure there were enough to meet public need.\nThat need declined so much last decade that Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, revised the rules to help local public authorities (LAs) stop BT and other operators scrapping phone boxes in places where, for example, poverty was so prevalent that people might depend on them.\nEverything had changed by 2017 and LAs found cause to oppose the kiosk produced by NYC.\nSmartphones had overloaded mobile phone networks in city centres with high demands for capacity. Comms firms proposed small cells: transmitters distributed along city streets to take strain off major mobile networks. Yet they would need favour from local planning authorities, and a network infrastructure.\nComms companies did deals with LAs to rent spaces on street furniture, such as lamp posts and CCTV columns, already linked with cable ducts. They offered to square public good with private greed in the New York model. LAs would get a cut of the money mobile operators paid to use the network infrastructure. Spare capacity would supply a free public Wi-Fi service, which LAs claimed would bridge the digital divide by ensuring anyone could get internet access, even if they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. Wi-Fi would be basic and time-limited. Those who wanted more and faster would pay, and LAs would take a cut of that as well.\nLAs hoped to make a lot of money. The London Borough of Camden \xe2\x80\x93 one of the first to act \xe2\x80\x93 was expected to earn \xc2\xa33.5m from a 10-year deal it signed in 2011 with Arqiva, a comms infrastructure firm that subsequently did most such deals. Sixteen other London boroughs joined on its terms. Camden valued the deal at \xc2\xa340m. The group estimated it would raise \xc2\xa320m.\nMichael Snaith, a consultant at Regional Network Solutions, who helped engineer the \xe2\x80\x98concession\xe2\x80\x99 contract model the LA deals followed, with his colleague Callum Knowles, said they advised on more than 40.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe aspiration was public Wi-Fi,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the driver was: \xe2\x80\x98We have these assets \xe2\x80\x93 how much can you pay for them?\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt became a problem, he said, that LAs thought it would be a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor income earner\xe2\x80\x9d, while the contractors promised too much. Camden\xe2\x80\x99s income projection for its 2011 deal had become \xe2\x80\x9cunachievable\xe2\x80\x9d, it said last year, \xe2\x80\x9cdue to the rising prevalence of other sources of free Wi-Fi and the availability of 4G\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOfficials in London\xe2\x80\x99s Hammersmith & Fulham borough said in February they were renegotiating the 2013 Wi-Fi deal they did with Arqiva because it had underachieved. Another deal to rent council cable ducts for networking might be abandoned.\nSouthampton City Council cancelled its 2013 Arqiva concession, according to a director who asks not to be named. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t delivering what we hoped. Take-up was almost nil. There was too much contention in the area. You have to stand extremely close to a transmitter if you are to avoid competing signals from surrounding shops and mobile,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. That contention was from Wi-Fi in places such as coffee shops.\nOther LAs had similar problems. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old market square is a very congested radio environment, with multiple Wi-Fi services being pushed out by shops,\xe2\x80\x9d says John Connelly, digital infrastructure manager at Nottingham City Council, which agreed a concession with BT in 2015.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen BT did the initial survey, they told us there are lots of signals competing. And when signals compete, they knock each other out. With the contention, if you have 50 people near an access point, all trying to get on the system, it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult for the cell.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on the number of access points you have. The more you have, the better the service,\xe2\x80\x9d says Connelly.\nBT addressed this in plans to install Wi-Fi in Glasgow, according to documents held by the City Council. It showed how LAs could spread uninterrupted Wi-Fi over central streets if they combined transmitters in phone kiosks with those BT put on lamp and CCTV posts under a concession it agreed with Glasgow in 2014.\nWhere neighbouring transmitters do not collaborate they contest, say public officials. David Oliver, solution architect for a Wi-Fi service Sheffield City Council set up last year under a 10-year concession, says it will not deliver a seamless service with InLinks BT is installing in the city as well. People would either log in to one or the other, or their phones might switch between them if they were subscribed to both, depending on which had the stronger signal.\nSheffield\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi signal has a 30Mbit/s capacity with blanket coverage, says Oliver. He has tried to find out from other LAs what is the typical speed of free public Wi-Fi, and thinks it is probably less than 10Mbit/s.\nPaul Neville, digital director at Waltham Forest, says its concession delivers 4Mbit/s\xc2\xa0 Wi-Fi, but the authority is working with Arqiva to double it.\nCapacity makes all the difference when facing contention, and the underlying network determines the capacity, according to Nottingham\xe2\x80\x99s Connelly.\nBT has claimed InLinks deliver free Wi-Fi at 1Gbit/s speeds, based on a fibre network it puts in when it installs them in choice spots on its old payphone network, with the cost of the rollout covered by advertising.\nLAs, government and concessionaires have all been striving to build fibre networks. Tower Hamlets, another London borough, made fibre a condition of the concession it sought to establish this year, with the cost to be covered by mobile phone operators who paid to use the network. It reckoned on making \xc2\xa33.5m on the deal.\nLAs did not give up on concessions after the first deals failed. Nor did they abandon the idea of making money from them.\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not a failure. It\xe2\x80\x99s an evolution. Because local authorities have released the assets, they have played an enabling role in the digital agenda.\xe2\x80\x99\nMichael Snaith, Regional Network Solutions\nThe City of London, authority for the financial district, reckoned it would make \xc2\xa318.5m from a concession it let last year to Cornerstone, a firm joint-owned by mobile operators Telefonica O2 and Vodafone.\nMobile operators\xe2\x80\x99 demand for small cells is reportedly uncertain. Their 4G services were notoriously late rolling out. But the delivery of 5G mobile broadband phones in 2020 is planned initially for city centres where it could be economically viable to distribute the small cells required to support them.\nWestminster City Council reckons it will make \xc2\xa322m from a 10-year deal it struck this year with Ontix Ltd, an unknown start-up.\nOther LAs setting up similar deals in the last 12 months include Liverpool, Coventry, Kingston and Hackney. Most of them opposed BT\xe2\x80\x99s InLink rollout by refusing all planning applications it made to install them. Whereas those LAs that had no such deal or had not recently reset them typically granted every InLink BT requested. Others, such as Southwark and Lambeth, have opposed significant numbers of InLinks while setting up deals of their own.\nBy examining records of 45 LAs where BT\xc2\xa0sought to install InLinks, and others significant by their concession deals or their being London boroughs, E&T found a confluence between self-interest and opposition to InLink.\nE&T viewed the records of more than 1,000 InLink planning decisions, as well as contract records, elected council proceedings and cabinet and committee papers where public authorities set out multi-million-pound deals with comms companies. Most of them kept the financial details from public view.\nTheir opposition was based on legitimate reasons under planning law, according to their own records. UK planning rules give comms companies special rights to install network equipment on the basis of there being a great public need for it. They must still make applications for each bit of equipment. LAs can oppose only the particular places where comms companies seek to put it, so they have some say over where it goes and how it looks, but the law forbids them blocking a network installation.\nIt forbade them blocking the BT rollout, yet many claimed InLinks were impractical in every location BT proposed, forcing BT to pursue its rollout in appeals before the planning ombudsman.\nWestminster took its opposition to the High Court in August, claiming phone boxes were such a nuisance that it should have power to refuse them. It chose for its contention an application by New World Payphones, another next-gen phone kiosk company previously owned by Arqiva.\nThe latter created coverage in Camden by combining access points on its kiosks with those on municipal furniture. Phone kiosks were likewise part of a concession bid it made in Waltham Forest last year.\nYet Camden wrote a public letter last month to Kit Malthouse, the government minister for housing and planning, asking for power to refuse kiosks when it believed there was no need. InLink UK, on the other hand, lobbied the London Mayor in March, begging power to stop LAs blocking its rollout because it had plans to put 5G cells in them.\nBristol City Council, which has licensed use of its street furniture to its \xe2\x80\x98Bristol is Open\xe2\x80\x99 joint venture with the University of Bristol, refused all 25 InLink applications this year. It has put \xc2\xa325.3m of government funding into the deal. Then last year it agreed a \xc2\xa35m street-advertising concession with JCDecaux, granting it spots on main roads where both ad-based kiosks and small-cell contractors vie for space. That is another form of concession LAs pursue. Camden had proposed forbidding its own concessionaire from displaying advertisements in order to protect revenue from its street advertising concessions.\nSouthwark said last year it might do a deal for JCDecaux to upgrade its billboards with Wi-Fi, while it prepared to put 5G small cells in street furniture. Islington was putting hotspots in benches. LAs up and down the country have been drawing up \xe2\x80\x98smart city\xe2\x80\x99 plans for networked street furniture and small-cell concessions. The reinvented phone kiosk has not appeared in their plans.\nSnaith says LAs were losing interest in free Wi-Fi, while some contractors believe their concessions have been a waste of time.\nReflecting on the generation of concession deals that LAs did on the NYC model, which Camden took up in 2012, Snaith insists they did not fail.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people would say they were a failure,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a failure. It\xe2\x80\x99s an evolution. Because local authorities released the assets, they have played an enabling role in the digital agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRead more: Cities block 5G kiosks after doing rival deals\nImage credit: E&T\nImage credit: E&T\ninformation and communications\ntelecommunications\ncommunication networks and services\ncommunication equipment and devices\nvolume 13 issue 10\n5g\ncommunications\ngovernment and politics\nSign up to the E&T News e-mail to get great stories like this delivered direct to your inbox every day.\nRelated stories\nUS cyber chief warns China will use Huawei to spy on UK\nComment\nAfter All: An historic German transport link that remains forever Belgian\nWindows 10 supports games controlled by eye movements\nMechanical Development Engineers\nDidcot, Oxfordshire\n\xc2\xa333,000 - \xc2\xa350,000\nMechanical Design Engineer\nDidcot, Oxfordshire\n\xc2\xa333,297 - \xc2\xa339,172 per annum (Discretionary range to \xc2\xa345,048)\nMinister warns UK mobile networks to be wary of using Huawei 5G equipment\nO2 announces plans to launch 5G this year\nHuawei requests $1bn+ in licensing fees from Verizon\nFoxconn founder\xe2\x80\x99s presidential hopes force corporate shake-up\nMPs compare Huawei to businesses that enabled Holocaust\nExclusive\nHow to hack an IoT device\n5G rollout hampered as tech giants limit employee access to Huawei\nRecent articles\nGraphene: what is it good for?\nComment\nFacebook\xe2\x80\x99s Libra, porn-filter delay, diversity benefits and more: best of the week\xe2\x80\x99s news\nSpaceX to launch \xe2\x80\x98sun sail\xe2\x80\x99 spacecraft\nComment\nView from Vitalia: Of edible tickets and taste buds that die last\nUK renewables overtake fossil fuels; 720km electricity cable laid between UK and Norway\n'Pete the plant' to take selfies to help monitor its environment\nHuawei filed patent for revamped foldable phone\nComment\nBizarre Tech: SPIN fire tube, RelaxoPet and self-solving Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube\nCan Big Data help curb the opioid crisis?\nTL,DR: Robot blood; Sino-British AI; camera plants; zero-carbon electricity\nComment\nBuzzwords: Doctor Who, \xe2\x80\x98Spidey sense\xe2\x80\x99, AI pet care and football fan interactivity\nFollow E&T magazine\nEngineering Communities\nBack to top\nMagazine\nLatest issue\nTablet editions\nWebinars\nWhite papers\nAbout E&T\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise with us\nSign up for news e-mails\nRelated sites\nE&T Jobs\nE&T Reference\nFollow The IET\nEngineering Communities\nBack to top\nMembership\nJoin now\nMyIET\nYour career\nProfessional registration\nCareer manager\nTraining courses\nAwards and scholarships\nElectrical\nWiring Regulations\nBuilding Regulations\nForum\nSectors\nBuilt environment\nDesign and production\nEnergy\nHealthcare\nTransport\nIET.tv\nE&T Magazine\nShop\nBooks\nJournals\nStandards\nTraining courses\nEvents\nInspec\nPolicy\nGovernment policy\nMedia centre\nPublishing\nWriting for us\nAdvertising with us\nEducation\nPrimary teaching resources\nSecondary teaching resources\nEvents\nAwards and grants\nIET Venues\nBirmingham - Austin Court\nLondon - Savoy Place\nCommunities and networks\nContact us\nHelp\nCookies\nPrivacy Statement\nAccessibility\nLegal notices\n\xc2\xa9 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.\nIET Services Limited is registered in England Registered Office Savoy Place, London, WC2R 0BL Registration Number 909719\nIET Services Limited is trading as a subsidiary of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, which is registered as a Charity in England & Wales (no 211014) and Scotland (no SC038698)\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\nLearn more about IET cookies and how to control them\nYes I agree", b"NYC will roll out thousands more kiosks offering free public Wi-Fi\nGo to the content\nGo to the footer\nClose\nNew York\nChange city\nNew York\n(en)\nEnglish\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\nPopular cities\nLondon\nNew York\nParis\nChicago\nLos Angeles\nLisbon\nHong Kong\nSydney\nMelbourne\nPorto\nSingapore\nBarcelona\nMadrid\nGirona\nBrowse all cities\nTickets\nEvents\nThings to Do\nTime Out Market\nRestaurants\nBars\nMovies\nTheater\nKids\nArt\nNews\nAttractions\nVideo\nHotels\nTravel\nMusic\nTO Book\nClasses\nMuseums\nShopping\nNightlife\nComedy\nDance\nLGBT\nSex & Dating\nBooks\nCity Guide\nNeighborhoods\nMagazine\nSweepstakes\nVenue Rental\nTime Out New York\nNew York\nEnglish\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\nPopular cities\nLondon\nNew York\nParis\nChicago\nLos Angeles\nLisbon\nHong Kong\nSydney\nMelbourne\nPorto\nSingapore\nBarcelona\nMadrid\nGirona\nBrowse all cities\nSubscribe\nLove Time Out?\nGet the best of your city in our newsletter, as often as you like\nD\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu!

Brought to you by Microsoft\nPosted: Monday October 15 2018, 12:53pm\nPhotograph: Courtesy LinkNYC\nWhen the sleek, black LinkNYC kiosks began popping up around New York in 2016, it felt sort of like the opening scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Technologically advanced monoliths from the future had suddenly materialized to drag us all into the future. Two years later, the internet-connected sidewalk kiosks\xe2\x80\x94which offer free Wi-Fi, free calling and USB ports to charge devices\xe2\x80\x94can boast\xc2\xa0more than 5 million registered Wi-Fi users who log an average of 20 million free sessions a week. Additionally, 500,000 phone calls are made on the kiosks every month.\nSo can we look forward to a sunny future where we can all cancel our private internet plans and log onto a free public network that blankets the city?\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, no. \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC kiosks are primarily designed for commercial corridors,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Kate Blumm, Assistant Commissioner at the NYC Department of Information Technology. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just one piece of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s larger plan to bring affordable high-speed internet to every New Yorker by 2025.\xe2\x80\x9d Additionally, the 1,700 kiosks that have been installed across the five boroughs (of a planned 7,500) only offer a Wi-Fi range of about 150 feet.\nWhen NYC originally conceptualized the project that eventually became LinkNYC, it was looking for a modern replacement for the city\xe2\x80\x99s aging payphone infrastructure. The winning proposal, from CityBridge, envisioned futuristic metal totems spread out across all five boroughs with giant, high-res screens on either side. Advertisements shown on the screens would then cover the cost of the kiosks themselves, and the city would be gifted with free, fast Wi-Fi infrastructure. To date, however, some of the most compelling uses of the kiosks have come from those screens rather than the Wi-Fi.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were surprised by how many people have been using them to make calls when everyone has cell phone, but a big part of the kiosks has been the content we display on the screens,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jennifer Hensley, the president of Link. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re able to provided curated content to help people make the most of their city through partnerships with local government and cultural institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s ranged from a recent initiative where New Yorkers could literally register to vote using the kiosks to information on good restaurants to hit up in the area, fun facts about the city and details on upcoming local events that those passing by might want to attend.\nOne of the criticisms of the kiosks from privacy advocates has been the inclusion of two cameras above the displays (along with a third camera above the tablet which could possibly be used for video calling in the future). Hensley insists, however, that the cameras above the New York devices are primarily for monitoring the structures themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re expensive pieces of hardware out on the streets so we want to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re safe,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\nAlong with the addition of thousands of more kiosks in the coming years, Hensley predicts that the devices will play a large part in coming years with helping New Yorkers have all the information they need to be counted in the 2020 census. However, by that time, Link will be helping more than just New Yorkers. The company has plans to expand into Newark this\xc2\xa0week\xc2\xa0and will soon spread to Philadelphia by the end of the year.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising\nShare\nTweet\nGuest blogger\nBy Will Gleason.

Oct. 16, 2018. (Courtesy: City of Newark)\nBy Karen Yi | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\nNew digital kiosks with 55-inch screens have\xc2\xa0sprouted across the city of Newark\xc2\xa0that will allow passers-by to make free phone calls, connect to public Wifi or charge their mobile devices.Newark is the first in New Jersey to\xc2\xa0launch the LinkNWK sidewalk\xc2\xa0kiosks\xc2\xa0created by\xc2\xa0Intersection, a New York-based technology company. New York City was the first to roll out the technology in 2016 and Philadelphia will install the kiosks later this fall.\nOn Tuesday, officials debuted\xc2\xa0the newly-installed\xc2\xa0kiosks across from the\xc2\xa0Prudential Center on Broad Street. A\xc2\xa0total of 45 kiosks will be in operation in the city -- with at least one in every ward. So far, two are up and running."Newark is once again defining itself to the state, nation, and world as a cutting-edge, high-tech city," Mayor Ras Baraka said. "These kiosks will enable residents and visitors alike to gain immediate information about Newark, ranging from upcoming cultural events to emergency service response."The kiosks, which Intersection installed at no cost to the city, display information on city services, fun facts about Newark, upcoming events and advertisements.The ad revenue will go to the company and be shared with the city as well.Representatives at\xc2\xa0Intersection said this time, the kiosks will not allow internet browsing. When the devices were first installed in New York City people used the kiosks to watch pornography, according to reports at the time.\nLinkNWK kiosk on Broad Street. Oct. 16, 2018. (Courtesy: City of Newark)\nThe company has not announced plans to install kiosks in any other New Jersey cities.The Newark kiosks will be the first to roll out with a Wifi app that allows users to connect to the LinkNWK network and pull up a map to find the nearest kiosk.\nNJIT has also partnered with Intersection\xc2\xa0to find creative ways of using the devices to benefit the community."Newark is a rising star in the tech economy, and we are proud that LinkNWK will only add to this momentum," said Jen Hensley, President of Link at Intersection.A minority investor in Intersection is Sidewalk Labs, which was created by Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

Clearly, this is a job for a LinkNWK kiosk.\nThe mayor was at Military Park downtown surrounded by a crowd of tech-looking hipsters, or hip-looking techsters, demonstrating the new advertiser-supported kiosks from the New York-based Intersection, which has deployed thousands of kiosks in London and New York.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese links here in Newark are special,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jen Hensley, president of LINK at Intersection. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re unique in the whole world because they\xe2\x80\x99re connected by municipal fiber. The city had the foresight to really invest in infrastructure, and today what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a manifestation of that in the form of services being offered for free to all of the residents, workers and visitors here.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s 26-mile superfast fiber optic network is now powering the city\xe2\x80\x99s rebranding, which includes a major push for the new Amazon HQ2. The first of these kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 there will be 45 in all at various commercial centers around the city \xe2\x80\x94 will be at Military Park, around which a transformation has already begun.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilitary Park is kind of a center of gravity in this section, gathering space, there\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of festivals, events, people come out, they eat here, so it\xe2\x80\x99s just been a game changer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newark Community Economic Development Corporation CEO Aisha Glover. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was kind of a hole in the doughnut here and it really sparked a lot of development. You know, Halsey is booming, a lot more restaurants are moving in, so it really changed the dynamic.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut if you\xe2\x80\x99re one of those people who fears \xe2\x80\x94 as an out of town reporter did \xe2\x80\x94 that the kiosks will attract some of the city\xe2\x80\x99s less affluent denizens, the mayor made it clear that serving them was part of this initiative.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has to be used to help everybody in society,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the mayor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just for the people across the street at Prudential. For somebody right there, sleeping in the park that uses that and finds a home, hell yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we want to use the kiosks for.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLocations and timelines are subject to city approvals but the first two kiosks, like all those signs of the city\xe2\x80\x99s comeback, have already arrived.\nDavid Cruz\nSenior CorrespondentSenior Correspondent David Cruz is an award-winning journalist with a 25-year career in television, radio and newspapers.

But beyond the idealistic marketing hype the reality is far more malignant.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAI\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t just asking Siri for directions or telling Alexa to turn on your lights; it\xe2\x80\x99s already being used\xe2\x80\x94and has been used for decades\xe2\x80\x94to decide who receives medical care, who attends which schools, and who receives housing assistance.\nIt can also be used to identify people and people and make predictions about their behavior, a type of AI known as facial recognition.\nFacial recognition software is already widespread. Customs and Border Protection uses it to screen non-U.S. residents on international flights and TSA plans to expand this to all international travelers. The New Orleans police department, in partnership with Palantir, was using facial recognition in its predictive policing program for six years before the public knew about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s estimated that half of all American adults are in some sort of facial recognition database.\nAnd at AI Now\xe2\x80\x94a symposium held October 16 about the intersection of artificial intelligence, ethics, organizing and accountability, presented by an NYU research institute of the same name\xe2\x80\x94panelists warned that facial-recognition technology has troubling implications for civil rights, especially amid current debates about who has access to public space.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should be deeply worried about the impact of AI face recognition on civil rights,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much of this implicates public space, contested public space, who can step into it, and what happens to us when we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNew York City\xe2\x80\x99s Domain Awareness system continually monitors people. This year, it was revealed that NYPD partnered with IBM to create facial recognition technology that can identity people by race.\nGetty Images\nThe rise of mass surveillance and biometric analysis in public space\nSince 9/11, mass surveillance has become the norm for law enforcement, which uses a variety of tactics to monitor people. Body cameras have become more common and security cameras are already ubiquitous. What\xe2\x80\x99s changing today isn\xe2\x80\x99t that we are being watched, it\xe2\x80\x99s who\xe2\x80\x99s doing the watching: computers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutonomous facial recognition\xe2\x80\x9d is a system that uses computer vision to look at images. Snapchat\xe2\x80\x99s filters and Apple\xe2\x80\x99s FaceID use computer vision, for example. Then, an algorithm\xe2\x80\x94designed by human programmers and data scientists\xe2\x80\x94processes those images and uses machine learning to analyze them by cross referencing the image to other data sources.\nThe facial recognition software technology companies are developing can identify a person in a crowd in real time, track someone\xe2\x80\x99s movements, detect emotions, and predict behavior. In a highly controversial study, one AI researcher claimed he could use facial recognition to predict someone\xe2\x80\x99s sexuality. IBM used NYPD footage to create software that lets police search for people by their skin color.\nThere are, of course, huge caveats with facial recognition technology: it\xe2\x80\x99s notorious for being highly inaccurate. Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s face-recognition software\xe2\x80\x94which analyzes facial attributes like gender and emotions\xe2\x80\x94wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who have been charged with a crime. Facial recognition software used by the Metropolitan Police, law enforcement in London, had an embarrassingly high rate of false-positive identifications: 98 percent.\nSherrilyn Ifill (left), Timnit Gebru (center), and Nicole Ozer (right) discussed the implications of facial recognition technology at AI Now\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 symposium.\nAndrew Federman courtesy AI Now\nWhy facial recognition is a Civil Rights issue\nDuring the AI Now panel, Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director of the ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s California chapter, called facial recognition technology a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave threat\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cfeeds off and exacerbates bias in society.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf facial recognition systems sound a lot like souped-up versions of phrenology\xe2\x80\x99s quack science, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are. Can someone look like a criminal? Look like they\xe2\x80\x99re about to cause harm? Appear to be a risk? Who decides that these traits actually signify criminality or risk? Or what a neutral expression is? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t much different than the stereotyping and profiling that happens today, which disproportionately affects people of color.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just recognizing a face; it\xe2\x80\x99s evaluating a person,\xe2\x80\x9d Ifill said of the technology.\nFacial recognition technology accelerates such judgments, makes them at a larger scale, and does so with a greater level of opacity. Then \xe2\x80\x9cwe deposit this tech into institutions that are unable to address inequality, and drop it into a period of racial profiling and Stop and Frisk,\xe2\x80\x9d Ifill said.\nTake New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Gang Database, which currently lists between 17,000 and 20,000 individuals. It\xe2\x80\x99s only one-percent white\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely clear how someone is added to the list or removed, which has potentially damaging effects if someone is labeled a gang member when they have no affiliations.\nIn December 2017 and February 2018, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a Freedom of Information Law request to understand how the NYPD builds, maintains, and and audits the database but didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive the documents it requested. In August, the advocacy groups sued the NYPD for failure to disclose its practices.\nAt its 2018 symposium, AI Now documented key moments in artificial intelligence news. Many of them relate to the use of facial recognition, including\nMicrosoft\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with ICE, in January; Palantir\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of predictive policing, in New Orleans, in February; an Amazon shareholder call for a moratorium of sales of face recognition tech to law enforcement revealed in June; Microsoft calling for federal regulation of facial recognition tech in July; and IBM and NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s partnership in September.\nAI Now\nWhy public space is a civil rights issue\nThe civil-rights implications of facial recognition become particularly clear in public space. What\xe2\x80\x99s troubling about this tech\xe2\x80\x94and data collection in general\xe2\x80\x94entering the public realm at a rapid clip is that they erode our constitutional rights to privacy, free speech, freedom of assembly, and due process. Meanwhile, our current political climate is becoming more hostile to these rights in public space. It\xe2\x80\x99s not too far of a stretch to see how facial recognition could make it worse.\nThe Trump Administration is actively trying to restrict access to public space that\xe2\x80\x99s popular with protesters. Would fewer people attend demonstrations if they knew their image could end up in a database just by attending? Police departments are already scanning crowds and protests to find and arrest people with outstanding warrants by cross referencing footage with social media profiles.\nFacial recognition adds fuel to the fire by making it impossible to move through public space freely. As Ifill said during the panel: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Civil Rights movement was about dignity in public space.\xe2\x80\x9d Facial recognition has the potential to strip dignity, all behind the scenes, and all surreptitiously.\nIfill draws parallels to the 1958 Supreme Court Case NAACP v. Alabama. In an attempt to intimidate Civil Rights activists, Alabama subpoenaed the NAACP\xe2\x80\x99s membership list, which the organization declined to do. The Supreme Court ruled that identifying who was in the NAACP would infringe on the right to privacy and free association.\nIn Wales, the human rights organization Liberty sued South Wales police for using facial recognition technology and told the Guardian, \xe2\x80\x9cThe police\xe2\x80\x99s creeping rollout of facial recognition into our streets and public spaces is a poisonous cocktail\xe2\x80\x94it shows a disregard for democratic scrutiny, an indifference to discrimination, and a rejection of the public\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental rights to privacy and free expression.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPublic space, in its lowest common denominator, is space that\xe2\x80\x99s open and accessible to all people regardless of race, age, income, sex/gender, or economic background. With facial recognition software in widespread use, you essentially lose privacy as soon as you enter the public realm. And public space ceases to be public if people can\xe2\x80\x99t freely use it\xe2\x80\x94including using it free of fear that they will be inaccurately profiled by humans or autonomous systems.\nPowerful technology with virtually no oversight\nThis summer, a group of Amazon employees called on Jeff Bezos to stop selling its face-recognition technology\xe2\x80\x94called Amazon Web Services Rekognition\xe2\x80\x94to law enforcement, citing concerns about violating human rights, especially considering the targeting of black activists by law enforcement and ICE\xe2\x80\x99s mistreatment of migrants and refugees. Just this week, Jeff Bezos essentially washed his hands of any culpability to civil or human rights violations related to Rekognition, saying that society\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimmune response\xe2\x80\x9d will eventually fix biased tech.\nThis week, an anonymous Amazon employee wrote a Medium post which discusses how law enforcement around the country\xe2\x80\x94specifically Orlando, Florida, and and unnamed Oregon sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department\xe2\x80\x94is testing facial recognition software with live video feeds and mugshot databases with virtually no public oversight.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just law enforcement that\xe2\x80\x99s playing into mass surveillance. Cities are using machine learning and computer vision to \xe2\x80\x9coptimize\xe2\x80\x9d their operations and redesign their systems. Sidewalk Labs is building a data-driven \xe2\x80\x9csmart city\xe2\x80\x9d in Toronto. Consumer brands are latching onto facial recognition software to target advertising in public space.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only know the tip of the iceberg on how the government is ramping up face surveillance and how companies are using it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ozer said.\nMore public oversight of facial recognition may be coming. This summer, the ACLU asked Congress to institute a moratorium on the use of facial recognition by government agencies. Microsoft also urged Congress to regulate the technology. New York City created an \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated Decision Systems Task Force\xe2\x80\x9d to create recommendations on how AI should be regulated and monitored. This summer, 20 experts in civil rights and artificial intelligence authored a letter to the task force with preliminary suggestions about what policy could look like. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is proposing a \xe2\x80\x9cCivic Data Trust\xe2\x80\x9d to oversee the information it will eventually collect.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a chilling game: count how many security cameras you pass on your way to work. I tried it yesterday and passed 85 on a trip that included about six blocks of walking in Brooklyn and Manhattan and passing through two subway stations. Some were private (the ones outside my apartment building and in its hallways, the cameras in front of shops and bodegas, and security cameras in and around my office building). Thirty-seven were associated with New York City governance (the NYPD cameras on light poles and service vehicles, security cameras in LinkNYC kiosks, cameras in MTA stations).\nWhat was troubling to me is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, off the top of my head, what the privacy policies are for any of these companies, how long footage is stored, who has deals to share data, or how secure any of the data is. Was I being profiled? By leaving my apartment, did my image enter some sort of database? I would have no idea, just like everyone else who ventures outside. (I looked into it and learned that some of the MTA\xe2\x80\x99s cameras feed into NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s Domain Awareness System, which uses facial recognition. According to a LinkNYC spokesperson, the company has a provision banning the use of facial recognition technology and does not send footage to the NYPD unless it is subpoenaed.)\nIn her opening statement to the symposium, AI Now co-founder Kate Crawford said a few words that stuck with me: \xe2\x80\x9cAI isn\xe2\x80\x99t tech; it\xe2\x80\x99s power, politics, and culture.\xe2\x80\x9d Right now, our political climate is hostile to our civil liberties, it\xe2\x80\x99s using its power to restrict access to public space, and we live in a culture of fear.

Here are the week\xe2\x80\x99s most important Wi-Fi news items:Ooredoo & Netgear announce world\xe2\x80\x99s first Wi-Fi 6 consumer productThe Gulf Times reports that Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s Ooredoo is \xe2\x80\x98planning to introduce\xe2\x80\x99 the Netgear Nighthawk AX12 Wi-Fi router to its customers as part of its fibre-based broadband offering. The announcement comes even before Netgear themselves have made any statement about their new Wi-Fi 6 product. With the launch, Ooredoo would become the first EMEA-region operator to deploy a Wi-Fi 6 solution.The Netgear AX12 is also the first consumer-grade Wi-Fi 6 product that we know of.\xe2\x80\x9cNighthawk AX12 offers Gigabit Internet up to 6 Gbps Wi-Fi speeds and WPA3, the latest Wi-Fi security standard designed for enhanced security in public and private networks. An ultra-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor ensures speed and performance for more Wi-Fi devices and high-speed applications,\xe2\x80\x9d the news report says.The photo of the Nighthawk AX12 rendered here to the left (courtesy Gulf Times) is the first photo we have seen of such a device. Reputable sources tell us that the new Netgear 12-stream device is powered by Qualcomm chips. Qualcomm is right now one of two chipset companies that we know of offering a 12-stream solution (the second company is\xc2\xa0Quantenna). The 12 streams are a consequence of 8 streams of 5 GHz plus four 2.4 GHz streams.Note: The above has been corrected since first published to reflect that both Qualcomm and Quantenna currently offer 12-stream Wi-Fi 6 chipset solutions. We apologise for previous inaccuracies.\xc2\xa0Qualcomm launches 10+ Gbps mmWave Wi-FiQualcomm is arguably the early front runner in the race to commercialise Wi-Fi 6 but the company is also not pulling any punches in getting to market first with new unlicensed millimetre wave gear. Last week Qualcomm launched its bid to dominate the 60 GHz chipset market with a family of products supporting the 802.11ay standard.The 802.11ay standard is essentially a souped-up (meaning bandwidth aggregated) and hence extremely fast version of 802.11ad-based 60 GHz Wi-Fi. The AY chips \xe2\x80\x93 now available for both infrastructure and mobile devices \xe2\x80\x93 bond several 60 GHz channels together to deliver speeds of more than 10 Gbps Wi-Fi, \xe2\x80\x9cextending Wi-Fi experiences to the 5G era,\xe2\x80\x9d the company says.As examples of how 60 GHz Wi-Fi is being used today, Qualcomm cites\xc2\xa0Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s Terragraph and smartphone vendor Asus, who launched the world\xe2\x80\x99s first 60 GHz capable device last year. Only a small handful of consumer-grade routers support the 802.11ad standard as of today.Qualcomm\xe2\x80\x99s launch also kind of begs the question as to what naming conventions may eventually be adopted for 802.11ad and 802.11ay products now that the Wi-Fi Alliance has announced new names for generations of 802.11-based products, most notably Wi-Fi 6. Qualcomm for the time being seems to have settled for \xe2\x80\x9960 GHz Wi-Fi\xe2\x80\x99 as at least the interim name for what used to be called WiGig.LinkNYC tops 5 million usersThe world\xe2\x80\x99s undisputed flagship City Wi-Fi project \xe2\x80\x93 LinkNYC of New York City \xe2\x80\x93 last month announced new user and network numbers. We kind of missed that but here they are for reference now: LinkNYC now tops 5 million users and some 20 million Wi-Fi sessions per week. The company also says more than 1700 kiosk units have been installed across the Big Apple.LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s younger sister-project in the UK is called InLinkUK and is operated by BT.

(LinkNYC Kiosk photo courtesy of CityBridge)\nSavvy ways to stay charged on the road\nTravel\nBy\nMyscha Theriault, Tribune News Service\nJuggling appointments, project deadlines and video conferencing from the road with a constant ticking clock on battery power is problematic to say the least. Factor in a GPS misfire, a flat tire or even an unexpectedly long meeting, and the situation is amplified significantly. During the past year, a few new options have floated across my radar for fighting this dilemma with as little frustration as possible. Following are my favorite strategies for keeping battery woes at bay.\nCombos: Carrying a separate battery backup and charging cable to keep your phone topped off can be a real drag when you are already running short of space in your gear bag. Finding a spot to plug in both devices along with your laptop at a crowded airport gate can be a frustrating feat as well. Recently, my husband and I discovered the existence of battery cases for our smartphones.\nSince the battery is located inside the protective case you place on your mobile anyway, you receive additional functionality out of an item you were already using. No extra storage space necessary. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no extra charging cord required since using the same attachment port you would normally use to charge your phone through your phone case charges both items at once. For less than $20 a pop, we ordered one for each of us and never looked back. We receive more than double the charge time and our equipment takes up as little space as possible. Ours are from a company called Accerzone, which makes cases to fit our particular phones, but prices are comparable for equivalent products to suit other models.\nSize: As with the cases mentioned above, the size of any piece of technical travel equipment is of specific concern. Bulky gear is always a bore, but portable battery rechargers can be exceptionally frustrating when it comes to finding luggage room. This is why my husband and I were so excited to find a miniature one by Nuon on the Batteries Plus website recently. Previously, we always switched between regular and rechargeable batteries whenever we transitioned between fast-paced travel to stationary periods where we slow down to work on more time-consuming projects. For 30 bucks, we now have a space-efficient option for recharging the batteries we use most often on the road for things such as specialized astronomy binoculars and red light headlamps.Another go-to piece of charging equipment for our household is a world power travel adapter by Targus. While the $20 price we paid was certainly right for our budget, what we really love most about it is the fact it all fits in a compact tube shape that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to pack. So many similar products can be enormous by comparison, and make working while abroad more frustrating than it needs to be, particularly on days when we need to change locations with all of our bags in tow. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been using this power adapter for several years now, and it continues to work seamlessly whenever we need it.\nInfrastructure: Any digital nomad who routinely uses fast food establishments and bookstore coffee shops to crank out some work between highway stops can attest to one highly inconvenient truth. Free Wi-Fi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean free electrical access to go with it. For those living out of a carry-on bag with limited space, one multi-plug adapter and a single extension cord will only get you so far, particularly if you need to go for long stretches of time between traditional charging options. In addition to in-flight power ports and more charging stations showing up at airports these days, some interesting new options are starting to show up in major cities.\nLinkNYC, for example, offers power charging and internet access at free-to-use kiosks throughout the Big Apple. Visitors needing to charge their mobile device can do so via a USB port connected only to power for security purposes, while still accessing the internet via a touch screen and keypad for free calls and information searching as they wait to power up. Residents and tourists alike can utilize these free stations as they search out eateries, transportation, polling locations and more. The kiosks even have ports to plug in your headphones so you can have privacy for any calls you need to make while you await a full charge. These same types of kiosks are also available throughout the U.K. in England, Wales and Scotland. Similar devices are coming soon to both Philly and Newark, N.J.Making your life work from the road can be challenging, but not impossible. With a few precision product purchases, planned access to infrastructure and a commitment to pay attention to power-hogging background apps, you can remain as charged as necessary for most situations.\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94(Lifestyle and travel expert Myscha Theriault blends thrift and luxury to live well for less around the world.

Announced by the destinations\' official marketing organizations, Discover Puerto Rico\xc2\xa0and NYC & Company, at an event hosted by Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda, the City-to-Island Partnership will urge travel between both U.S. destinations over the holiday season and beyond.\n"Puerto Rico and New York City share so much in common," said Charles Flateman, board vice chairman of NYC & Company, during the event, which was held in Manhattan\'s El Museo del Barrio. "Both are tourism destinations rich in design, in cuisine, culture, innovation and so much more -- and clearly there is a long and special affinity between these two destinations."\nThe partnership will include an exchange of marketing and advertising assets valued at more than $300,000 over a three-month period, beginning Nov. 19, 2018. Select billboards will be placed throughout San Juan, Puerto Rico, with the tagline "Famous Original, New York City. Always here for you," in English and Spanish, while Puerto Rico will promote its offerings on bus stop shelters and LinkNYC screens throughout New York City\'s five boroughs with the tagline "We\'re Ready to Celebrate."\nThe partnership, aimed at meetings and business events as well as individual leisure travelers, is rolling out as Discover Puerto Rico emphasizes that the destination has significantly recovered from the devastation of last year\'s hurricane season. Discover Puerto Rico CEO Brad Dean said they were, "not just simply open for business, but we are eager to welcome visitors back to the island" and that "we hope New Yorkers will take this opportunity to help accelerate the economic recovery.\nThe campaign is rolling out in time for the holiday season in both destinations, whether the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in New York or the Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico. But Dean emphasized that in addition to the 132 hotels and many other offerings already available to visitors, this winter will see the opening of four more historic properties: Caribe Hilton; El San Juan Hotel, Curio Collection;\xc2\xa0Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve; and the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort. It will also see the Puerto Rico engagement of the Broadway smash Hamilton, running Jan. 8-27, 2019, in which Miranda will reprise his role as Alexander Hamilton for a three-week run at the University of Puerto Rico\'s main campus in San Juan.\n"Nothing is better for your soul than to go visit Puerto Rico," said Miranda, in his remarks emphasizing his own personal connection to the island, going there every summer to visit his grandparents and having his grandparents come to Yankee games in New York City. "This relationship between New York and Puerto Rico is not just a decade. It is a lifelong, generations-long thing and it is so wonderful to ratify that and declare Puerto Rico is open for business."\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by Disqus\nNewsletters\nMeeting News\nHow-To\nTop 10 Newsletter\nTech Insider\nMeeting Deals\nSign Up for More ENLs\nMost Popular\nmost read\nHow to Win Employees Over When You\'re a New Leader\nHow to Start Your Day Off on the Right Foot\n5 Ways to Incorporate Wellness Into Corporate Events\nHow to Stay Hydrated So You Sleep Better\nHow to Make Your R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 Feel Current\nHow to Respond When an Employee Tenders His/Her Resignation\nsmall meetings cvbs dmos destinations webcast\nWellness Tips Corporate Events Washington Duke Inn\nTop Women Speakers Motivation Inspiration\nCreative Ways Incorporate Golf Meetings\naustin-texas-meetings-group-activities\nTips Creating Perfect Lighting Look Meetings Events\nsponsored video\nVegas Is The Place To Meet\nVegas is equipped with meeting spaces alongside top-notch hospitality and amenities, all located within minutes of the airport.\nrelated\nDestinations\nSan Francisco Goes Big on MeetingsPark City\'s Stunning OfferingsLong Beach Keeps Meetings FreshHawaii\'s Island Meetings Attractions3 Days In\xe2\x80\xa6San AntonioCosta Rica\'s Rich Meetings OfferingsSouth Florida Woos MeetingsMichigan Meetings Update\nf\nl\ni\nHome\nStrategy\nNews\nResources\nEvents\nSupplied Content\nfind or a post a job\nHome\nStrategy\nNews\nResources\nEvents\nSupplied Content\nf\nl\ni\nAbout Us\nSubscribe\nNewsletter\nContact Us\nAdvertise With Us\nEditorial Calendar\nPrivacy\nTerms\nNorthstar Travel Media Sites\nTravelAge West\nTravel Weekly\ntravel42\nHotel & Travel Index\nOfficial Hotel Guide\nOfficial Cruise Guide\nThe Beat\nPhoCusWright\nStar Service Online\nBusiness Travel Planner\nIntelliguide\nIncentive\nMeetings & Conventions\nBusiness Travel News\nSports Travel\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019 by Northstar Travel Media LLC.

At an\xc2\xa0event on Tuesday hosted by Lin-Manuel Miranda, NYC & Company and Discover Puerto Rico signed a one-year alliance to encourage \xe2\x80\x9creciprocal travel,\xe2\x80\x9d with a new advertising campaign and\xc2\xa0swapping of marketing tips. Miranda is also bringing his award-winning show \xe2\x80\x9cHamilton\xe2\x80\x9d to the island from January 8 to January 27 at the Univesity of Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s San Juan campus. All proceeds from the engagement\xc2\xa0will go toward an art fund on the island\xc2\xa0founded by Miranda.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a first generation New Yorker with parents from Puerto Rico and family on the island, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt a special connection not only to my life in upper Manhattan but with my roots and summers spent in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico,\xe2\x80\x9d Miranda said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not exist without both or either. Today\xe2\x80\x99s public commitment and bond between these two places that I hold so dear could not be more meaningful.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe dual campaign will cost $308,000 and run between November 19 and January 13. The promotion includes ads for the Big Apple on billboards in San Juan and ads promoting the island on bus stop shelters and Link NYC screens across the five boroughs.\nThe new tagline \xe2\x80\x9cFamous Original, New York City. Always here for you.,\xe2\x80\x9d which will also be written in Spanish, will be featured in the promotions. Through this message, the agency hopes to remind Puerto Ricans that they are always welcome to NYC.\nPuerto Rico\xc2\xa0will encourage New Yorkers to visit the island over the holidays, with a marketing campaign bosting \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re Ready to Celebrate,\xe2\x80\x9d which shows off their classic Three King\xe2\x80\x99s Day celebration and the San Sebastian street festival.\nThe partnership comes just over a year after Hurricane Maria, a\xc2\xa0damaging storm that took\xc2\xa0nearly 3,000 lives. New York City, which has the largest number of Puerto Rican residents in the mainland of the U.S, will soon be home to a permanent Hurricane Maria Memorial; Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month established a\xc2\xa0commission to provide recommendations on its site and design.\nCurrently, there are about 26 flights daily between the NYC area and Puerto Rico.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City and Puerto Rico share a diverse culture and vibrancy that cultivates a unique affinity between the two destinations, and there could not be a better time for us to align our efforts,\xe2\x80\x9d Fred Dixon, the president of NYC & Company, said.\nRELATED:\nCuomo will bring a Hurricane Maria Memorial to Battery Park City\nTo boost travel from Southeast Asia, NYC tourism agency opens new office in Singapore\nLatin in Manhattan: A look at early Hispanic New York\nTags :\nHurricane Maria, NYC & Company\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\nJoin the discussion when you sign in with one of the following methods:\nfacebook Sign In\nSign In\n[userpro template=login force_redirect_uri=1 login_button_secondary='' login_button_primary='Sign In Now' login_side='' login_heading='' ]\t\t\tForgot Password?\nDon't have an account?

All you need to do is walk over to one of the city's newly installed kiosks in neighborhoods across the city.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree is pretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d quipped Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland, as he moderated a panel discussion in mid-October at the 2018 MetroLab Network Summit on the campus of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark.\nThe project, known as LinkNWK (pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cLink Newark\xe2\x80\x9d), launched Oct. 16, 2018, and is a partnership between the city, the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, NJIT and Intersection, a maker of kiosks and the supporting software technology. Intersection will install up to 45 of the kiosks all across the city in the coming weeks.\nRELATEDAurora, Ill., Eyes Downtown Smart KiosksAustin's Solar-Powered Kiosk Charges Phones, E-Bikes and Cars KC Kiosks Avoid LinkNYC's Porn Troubles, Rollout Going Smoothly\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNewark is incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mayor Ras J. Baraka, speaking during the mayoral panel at the Summit. \xe2\x80\x9cIt allows people to make phone calls anyplace in the world they want to. It allows people to charge their cellphone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baraka, adding that the kiosks also provide city maps, information about local events and more. In addition, the kiosks act as free Wi-Fi hot spots around the city.\nThe kiosks on Newark streets join other similar units in New York, London and other cities in the United Kingdom. Intersection is set to launch LinkPHL in Philadelphia in the coming weeks.\nSome of the other information provided by the kiosks includes news and weather, information about cultural programs, opportunities for civic engagement, local photography and more.\nLike many smart city projects in Newark, they are supported by Newark Fiber, a program to bring affordable gigabit-speed Internet service to Newark. The network spans some 26 miles, said Baraka. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of it is being used, particularly in the downtown area and some of the parks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMillions of people in New York and London have enjoyed Link\xe2\x80\x99s free, super-fast Wi-Fi, useful information, and other free services,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jen Hensley, president of Link at Intersection, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cNewark is a rising star in the tech economy, and we are proud that LinkNWK will only add to this momentum.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe kiosk services are free and are supported through advertising, similar to how kiosks are funded in other cities like Kansas City, Mo., or New York City.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a company, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to provide continual support to an area where so many of our customers and employees live, work and visit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Krolick, vice president of marketing at United Airlines, a sponsor of the LinkNWK project, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThese new kiosks are another example of connecting Newark with the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story stated all 45 kiosks have been installed. The kiosks project is partially deployed, and more will come online in the coming weeks.\nSkip Descant\nStaff Writer\nSkip Descant writes about smart cities, the Internet of Things, transportation and other areas.

Welcome to the era of free wi-fi in Newark.\nBy Eric Kiefer, Patch Staff\nOct 26, 2018 7:00 am ET\n{{ replyButtonLabel }}\nReply\n{{ replyCount }}\nNEWARK, NJ \xe2\x80\x94 With cameras rolling and flashes popping, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka leaned into the high-tech kiosk at Military Park, placing his phone call with a feigned casualness, as if he was ordering a pizza at home in his living room. "Hi, this is Mayor Baraka\xe2\x80\xa6 how y\'all doing today?" he asked the worker on the other end of the line. "I\'m trying to order something to pick up." After hearing the restaurant\'s menu, Baraka decided on an order of tacos. "I\'m going to send somebody to get \'em," he said. "I\'ll see y\'all in a minute." And with that symbolic order of food, Newark took a flying leap into a new era of technology. Last week, Baraka, city officials and several community leaders gathered in Military Park for the activation of Newark\'s first LinkNWK kiosks, which deliver free wi-fi, offer mobile device charging, make phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. and allow access to a plethora of municipal services, maps and directions. The kiosks \xe2\x80\x93 which are run by tech company Intersection \xe2\x80\x93 make use of Newark Fiber, the city\'s public-private gigabit data network. Eventually, Intersection will install 45 LinkNWK kiosks throughout the city\'s five wards, including: Newark Penn StationPrudential CenterBroad Street, Market Street, Martin Luther King Blvd. and Irvine Turner Blvd."Neighborhood corridors" such as Clinton Avenue, Ferry Street, South Orange Avenue and Bloomfield AvenueA collaboration between Intersection, the City of Newark, the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation (NCEDC) and New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the kiosks are expected to help Newark cement a rising reputation as a "cutting-edge, high-tech city," Baraka stated. See related article: Newark Is 1st In N.J. To Use High-Tech Kiosks"We are the only city in the entire state and the second in the nation to provide these services, and every person who uses one of these kiosks will not only gain the services they need, but learn something more important: Newark is a world-class urban leader," Baraka said. According to municipal officials, the kiosks operate at no cost to taxpayers or users. Instead, they\'ll be supported by advertising revenue, some of which will also help fund other "smart infrastructure" programs in the Brick City through contributions to the NCEDC. Initial advertisers on the kiosks include United Airlines, which operates a hub out of Newark Airport.\nDon\'t forget to visit the Patch Newark Facebook page here.

The lack of infrastructure planning combined with economic growth forced the Government to ration the energy supply from its main urban centres, for intermittent periods of time. Back then, as a student living in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, I remember streets darkening as the sun went down. In one of those evenings, walking back home from university, two men driving a motorcycle stopped right in front of me. One of them jumped off the bike and before I knew it, he hit me on the head with the back of his gun and stole my backpack.\nS\xc3\xa3o Paulo is one of the many existing (and emerging) megacities feeling its \xe2\x80\x98growing pains\xe2\x80\x99 due to an increased demand for ever more comfortable lifestyles. From a strategic standpoint, although cities only occupy 2 percent of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s landmass, they are where 75 percent of resource consumption and most brand communications are concentrated.\nMoreover, the global media and advertising footprint also comes with a hefty environmental toll. In the UK, for instance, advertising is responsible for two million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to heating 50 percent of London\xe2\x80\x99s social housing, according to CarbonTrack.\nMarkets, choice and competition are not just a consumers\xe2\x80\x99 best friend, but their political representation. Brands able to broaden their audiences from customers to citizens and their revenue model from sales to the creation of shared value will be the game-changers driving our industry forward. This is the type of thinking required to embrace Urban Brand Utility (UBU), an approach to brand communications I conceived and have been advocating for.\nWhat Urban Brand Utility should look (and be) like: Useful, profitable and impactful\nUBU is about using brands\xe2\x80\x99 touch points as more than mere messengers to supplementing public utility services and minimising carbon dioxide emissions.\nSuch logic can turn brand communications into a regenerative force for cities, where the promotion of goods and services is not only more profitable, but also environmentally enriching and socially virtuous.\nIn Moscow, for example, Sberbank was approached by major Russian real estate developers to collaborate on better infrastructure planning in residential areas. People\xe2\x80\x99s opinions on local needs fuelled targeted campaigns, promoting loans for small businesses. The \xe2\x80\x98Neighbourhoods\xe2\x80\x99 campaign generated nine times as many small business responses than traditional loan advertising.\nIn other words, people had their needs addressed as neighbourhoods became more attractive. The city increases tax collection from the new businesses being set up, which also reduces the cost related from having to deal with derelict areas. As the biggest Russian bank, caring about citizens is not just a nice thing to do but an effective way for Sberbank to positively impact its bottom line.\nCitizen-consumers are important players in enabling business to tackle the issues that matter most. As important as it is to reduce the number of clicks on a consumer journey, improving our life journeys will often result in superior returns.\nAware that potholes, cracks and bumps in the road can cause irreversible damage to people\xe2\x80\x99s pizzas during the drive home, Domino\xe2\x80\x99s decided to pave towns across the US (using its branding) and save their customers\xe2\x80\x99 pizzas from the bad roads. Obviously, not only Domino\xe2\x80\x99s customers benefited from this effort, but every single driver going through the few selected roads.\nThis may sound silly, but according to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission of the U.S. Congress, the annual investment required by all levels of government to simply maintain the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highways, roads and bridges is now an estimated $185 billion per year for the next 50 years. Today, the nation annually invests about $68 billion.\nMayors and city managers from the municipalities where \xe2\x80\x9cPaving for Pizza\xe2\x80\x9d has taken place have acknowledged the creation of shared value.\nFor Eric Norenberg, the city manager of Milford, DE: \xe2\x80\x9cWe appreciated the extra Paving for Pizza funds to stretch our street repair budget as we addressed more potholes than usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTowards new revenue models underpinned by creative urban resilience\nAdvertising is the soul of the capitalist system and the best incentive to upgrade it is to create new revenue streams. For one, a brand that shows itself relevant and useful is more likely to cut through the noise and increase sales. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also a bigger commercial model to be explored. First, by definition, UBU programs have three core objectives:\nEnabling savings or new earnings for cities\nCreating shared value for the cities\xe2\x80\x99 inhabitants, and\nDelivering superior return on media investment (ROMI).\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical situation. Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Paving for Pizza program generates a $10 million surplus to the city of Bartonville by minimising the costs from dealing with potholes. Rather than treating this as a one-off campaign, smart mayors would try and create a virtuous cycle, where 50 percent of the surplus is retained by the city, 25 percent is returned to the advertiser and 25 percent to the agency and media owner \xe2\x80\x94 a value only unlocked by repeating the approach.\nThe more advertisers communicate their messages in a way that benefits brand, people and city, the cheaper it becomes to do more of it \xe2\x80\x94 and, the more cities encourage such an approach, the faster societal problems will be addressed. In other words, UBU programs become a catalyst, igniting brand love, smartening cities and improving their economies, as shown on the model below.\nAs with the idea of a circular economy, where the life cycle of products and services goes beyond end users, UBU looks at brand communications as closed loops by designing a system bigger than fixed campaign periods, target audiences and business-as-usual KPIs. This way, marketing budgets are effectively turned into investment funds with returns in the form of brand cut-through, happier customers, social impact and more effective city management \xe2\x80\x94 as Heineken is aiming to achieve through its Cities Project, for example.\nMaking a brand\xe2\x80\x99s touchpoints become the new Agoras\nTo make the model scalable, however, a digitised mechanism would be required. An interesting case of civic engagement enabled by outdoor media has recently gone live in New York City.\nThe Participatory Budgeting campaign invited New Yorkers to decide how to spend US$1 million of the public budget through digital panels spread across the city. This means that the same touch point used to communicate is also used to enable the action it asks audiences to undertake \xe2\x80\x94 a paradigm shift where advertising can finally walk its talk.\nThe company behind the \xe2\x80\x98voting outdoor panels,\xe2\x80\x99 Intersection, started up by repurposing New York City\xe2\x80\x99s now-obsolete pay phones as totems offering free broadband Wi-Fi connectivity to residents and visitors, and media space for advertisers.\nBesides supplementing New York\xe2\x80\x99s broadband network and now enhancing civic life, the LinkNYC totems have projected an incremental US$500 million in ad revenue for the city as part of a 12-year contract, by unlocking new value from underutilised assets.\nJust like the Ancient Greek public squares \xe2\x80\x94 the Agoras \xe2\x80\x94 where direct democracy was born, this emerging participatory media can effectively collect complaints and suggestions for cities\xe2\x80\x99 improvement, in real time. The next step for this could then be the matching of brands that align with specific urban challenges.\nThis way, instead of top-down public-private contracts, issues are identified by local constituents informing future UBU programs, as wanted by the people and enabled by advertising media.\nThis can be done by following six strategic imperatives:\nTranslate the big idea that defines your brand into a big utility that can operationalise its impact.\nReplace interruptive interactions with enhancing ones by delivering a public utility service.\nTurn any existing utility of a communications effort from a stunt into a sustained practice.\nShift your business focus from short-term sales results to longer-term profitability.\nBroaden your audiences from customers to citizens, expanding paths-to-purchase into life journeys.\nDiversify revenue from sales to the creation of shared value.\nAs a comparison, Magna Global estimated that in 2018, global media spending in brand communications will reach US$551 billion; but, according to the Pike Institute, by 2020 investment in smart city infrastructure will not surpass US$108 billion \xe2\x80\x94 an approximate 5:1 ratio, respectively.\nThrough the UBU approach the current US$ 551 billion could merge into the much larger pie of Global Welfare & Security spend of US$ 40.5 trillion, a figure obtained by dividing Gross World Product (GWP) by the 30 percent global average spent on welfare and security, as per the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThe above, at least in theory, would be plausible as advertisers would then become key players in public-private-partnerships.\nMedia and advertising have powered a linear economy that is now facing severe challenges. Conversely, urbanisation has fuelled population growth that went from a sign of prosperity to one of alarm. The strategic opportunity is to bend the line and turn the existing real estate and brand communication infrastructure into a network of creative urban resilience that benefits all parties involved and educates everyone in the value chain.\nAs we've noted, markets, choice and competition are not just consumers\xe2\x80\x99 best friend, but their civic representation.

With thousands of screens encouraging New Jersey residents to vote, and offering helpful resources for voters on the go, we hope to support a strong showing of democracy this Election Day,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Ruth Fasoldt, Link's Director of External Affairs.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis initiative by LinkNWK will enable people in Newark to find out vital information about voting locations, hours, and procedures at the touch of a computer screen,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI am extremely pleased that LinkNWK has partnered with us to use 21st-century technology to enable us to help people to vote.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dThe campaign is Link\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s third initiative this election cycle to promote voter awareness, engagement, and turnout. In New York, Links recently promoted New York State\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s primary election in September, which saw record voter turnout in the city, through reminders and local poll site information. Leading up to New York\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s voter registration deadline of October 12th, Link kiosks ran two campaigns encouraging New Yorkers to register to vote. The initiative consisted of a countdown clock up until the registration deadline as well as local statistics about how many people had registered to vote in each election district. Link also provided the ability for New Yorkers to register through the Link tablet in 2016 and 2018.The general election campaign represents the first civic engagement initiative for LinkNWK, which launched in Newark on October 16. Philadelphia will become the next city to launch a Link network later this year.The article continues after this ad\xc2\xa0 \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNewark is once again defining itself to the state, nation, and world as a cutting-edge, high-tech city. These kiosks will enable residents and visitors alike to gain immediate information about Newark, ranging from upcoming cultural events to emergency service response,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Mayor Baraka. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe are the only city in the entire state and the second in the nation to provide these services, and every person who uses one of these kiosks will not only gain the services they need, but learn something more important: Newark is a world-class urban leader.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dLinkNWK is the result of a collaboration between The City of Newark, The Newark Community Economic Development Corporation (NCEDC), the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Intersection to enable city residents to benefit from Newark Fiber \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 a program designed to bring affordable gigabit internet to the city.

The sidewalk technology stations were part of a major Get Out the Vote effort by flashing constant reminders for residents to vote.\nIn the days leading up to Election Day, the 55-inch screens on LinkNYC kiosks displayed reminders to vote, along with information on polling site hours. Residents could also find their polling sites by using the Link tablet.\nThe idea is to offer busy New Yorkers information on the go, officials said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLink has transformed the way information is delivered on city streets, and supporting civic engagement has become a core part of our mission.

And as the city\xe2\x80\x99s Oct. 12 voter registration deadline approached, the technology stations flashed messages reminding people that they had to register by that date in order to be eligible to vote on Nov. 6.\nFor statistics fans, the screens displayed information on how many people had registered to vote in each election district.\nThere are more than 1,700 LinkNYC kiosks around the city, including hundreds in Brooklyn.\nThe kiosks are part of an ambitious technology initiative launched by Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications in 2016.

Dynamic opportunities like this are helping drive channel growth, as OOH ad spend rose 1.2% last year compared to 2016, accounting for $7.7 billion, according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA). By 2021,\xc2\xa0a MAGNA Intelligence study predicts OOH spend will reach $33 billion.\nOther changes are also evident as OOH advertising evolves. Trade organization Traffic Audit Bureau for Media Measurement, which has audited the circulation of OOH media in the U.S. since 1933, changed its name to Geopath in 2016 and is now embracing data, technology and media research to measure and analyze how consumers engage with OOH ads. In an interview with Marketing Dive, Geopath CEO Kym Frank discussed some of the changes taking place in the space and highlighted key trends impacting marketers.\nDynamic creative and custom triggers\nWhile printed signs still dominate, digital OOH inventory is taking new shape and presenting advertisers with the potential to deliver more dynamic creative and custom triggers. Jukeboxes in bars, large format digital signs lining highways, digital bus shelters and signage in malls and restaurants across America are spurring marketers to experiment with the channel. In the past, such deployments were often considered experimental or a one-off test, but nowadays dynamic creative in OOH is becoming more scalable, Frank said.\nFor instance, advertisers can now change the creative based on the speed of traffic going past a digital billboard. If traffic is flowing at 60 miles an hour, drivers may only have time to read 10 words or so on a billboard. But if traffic is congested or at a standstill, drivers may be able to read up to 150 words. Messaging and creative can be instantly adjusted to match these conditions and better capture consumers\' attention.\n"Digital is allowing advertisers to be more reactive and serve dynamic creative often based on custom triggers," Frank said.\nIntegration of mobile into OOH\nAdvertisers can also dynamically trigger ads based on the types of mobile devices near the OOH channel, meaning an iPhone owner might see a different ad than an Android user.\xc2\xa0Advertisers are also geofencing their digital billboards so after drivers who have seen the ad leave the area, they can be retargeted with a personalized ad on their mobile device.\xc2\xa0For example, if searches for flu medication are peaking in the area, a billboard ad for a pharmacy might adjust the creative to promote certain products at the pharmacy and then the retailer can send passersby an offer.\n"Advertisers are getting very creative in how to use the medium, now we are seeing weather triggers, search query triggers, and even messaging based on what is currently playing on a radio station served to a billboard as you drive by," Frank said.\nData improves measurement\nThe OOH industry has made big investments in measurement systems to glean the kinds of metrics typically associated with digital channels, according to Frank. As a result, brands now have the ability to look at who has been exposed to an ad campaign on a digital billboard and track the behavior of the consumer afterward. While in the past marketers would have had to survey people and ask if they recalled seeing a billboard, now marketers know what consumers passed OOH ads and whether the marketing message contributed to an online search or purchase.\n"This is a massive technology data ecosystem that we didn\'t have access to 10 years ago and suddenly we have so many new toys to play with as an industry."\nKym Frank\nCEO, Geopath\nUsing data from connected cars, marketers can also perform more granular segmentation and targeting of audiences.\n"So rather than just looking at standard demographics, we can now look at people in the market for a new car or people who are planning to go to a college or university within the next year," Frank said.\nThe rise of automation\nAutomation and programmatic trading have reached the OOH industry. The buying and selling of OOH ad space was once a cumbersome process that involved negotiating pricing between the advertiser or the agency and the media seller and sending the creative off to a printer. Someone would then have to go out, take a photo of the unit and send that to the advertiser. These days, the process has become far more automated and efficient.\nSome programmatic platforms allow advertisers to buy both mobile ads and OOH units directly through the same interface, enabling more integrated location-based strategies. With automated platforms, it\'s also easier for advertisers to upload files and for installers to snap digital photos during installation to deliver proof of deployment to the advertiser and agency in real time.\nDigital OOH units can also be tracked throughout the day, similar to any other digital ad, delivering analytics results much faster than traditional methods allowed.\n"This applies to anything from roadside billboards to jukeboxes in a bar," Frank said. "It spans the gamut of sizing."\nSmart cities stimulate growth\nCities are becoming more connected than ever before, offering interactive digital kiosks with maps, free Wi-Fi and local destinations. These city-run services are a great opportunity for advertisers to connect with audiences. New York\'s LinkNYC and other projects in the works in New Rochelle, New York, and Austin, Texas, highlight that it\'s not necessarily just OOH companies putting ad inventory into the marketplace.\n"Eventually these city projects become ad-supported and become part of the out-of-home ecosystem, and we expect that to become more and more prevalent," Frank said. "Who is running them will be interesting to see. Sometimes it is out-of-home companies, sometimes it is digital companies and sometimes, it is the cities themselves. This is a massive technology data ecosystem that we didn\'t have access to 10 years ago and suddenly we have so many new toys to play with as an industry."\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nMarketing Tech\nCreative\nAnalytics\nMobile\nTop image credit:\nLamar Advertising\nGet marketing news like this in your inbox daily.

Specific technologies such as distributed sensing, public data, and modular electricity infrastructure are paramount to smart city projects. Diving right into the details of these technologies without contextualizing them in real cities, however, would further the dangerous approach of solutions-first thinking. Individual cities, much like people, are all unique. Looking at specific technologies prior to understanding a city\xe2\x80\x99s needs is a bit like handing a surfer an umbrella or giving a newborn baby a copy of Infinite Jest.In order to manifest the intentions behind a smart city\xe2\x80\x94to make individual aspects of urban life better\xe2\x80\x94those interested in the field must start with context.

Only after understanding it fully can they introduce solutions. || #IoTForAll @MarcBielas Click To TweetRather than focusing on a single technology, this article will introduce a series of smart city strategies as they pertain to leading cities in the field. These strategies represent different but equally important approaches to urban innovation: investments in distributed sensing, infrastructural improvements, and e-Governance. By diving into the work done in New York, Barcelona, and Tallinn, this post will give you a better understanding of the broad range of available methodologies and technologies in the smart city industry.Sensors and Data:\xc2\xa0New York City, U.S.A.Population: 8.6 millionImage Credit: LinkNYCNew York City is a leader in successful sensor deployment and public data access, having incorporated sensing across many city functions including water metering and transportation. In 2009, the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Environmental Protection, which delivers 1 billion gallons of water a day to 8.6 million residents, developed an advanced meter reading system consisting of 817,000 individual water meters across the city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs. By regularly sending water readings to the department\xe2\x80\x99s operational center, these sensors provide citizens and the government with real-time access to water usage monitoring and easy billing.By eliminating the need for manual metering, the city decreased tax expenditure by $3 million dollars annually. Additionally, the system reduced the need to estimate water usage from 17% to 3% of buildings, meaning that citizens are now more likely to pay for actual usage as opposed to estimated amounts. This reduction caused billing disputes to drop by 56%, developing secondary economic benefits. Furthermore, nothing stops the city from continuously analyzing water data and developing new tools on top of simple metering. One such tool for leak notification has saved users hundreds of millions of dollars since it was rolled out in 2011.New York City faces a host of issues related to moving people across the city. It has the highest public transit ridership in North America\xe2\x80\x941.73 billion riders in 2017. With an aging transportation infrastructure, the city has taken multiple approaches to modernization. Buses, which support the movement of 2.5 million passengers every weekday, are largely unreliable due to traffic.In order to improve bus service and further incentivize its use, NYC\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) developed a system called Transit Signal Priority (TSP) to decrease the amount of time buses spend at red lights from the historic average of 20%. Since 2008, TSP has used GPS trackers built into public buses and data integration into the city\xe2\x80\x99s traffic lights either to trigger early green lights or to extend a green light when a bus nears an intersection. Since this entire system is digital, the city can continue to decrease bus commute times by tuning specific variables. By 2017, TSP was already deployed in 260 locations and five bus routes throughout the city. Moreover, it had reduced bus delays by about 20%, increasing the viability of aboveground public transit. As this solution expands to more intersections and routes, the city will be able to capture the environmental and economic benefits of even higher transit ridership.\xc2\xa0With sensors becoming ubiquitous, the amount of data available for analysis is growing rapidly. The NYC government and other cities already produce more data than they know what to do with. These datasets, when combined and analyzed, could continuously reveal potential opportunities for innovation. Key findings might lead to viable business models.\xe2\x80\x9cOpen Data\xe2\x80\x9d has become a popular idea in the smart city field. Today, NYC provides more than 1,000 open datasets through its public OpenData platform. Citizens and corporations alike can use the available data to discover new ways of improving the urban experience. An example of this was the analysis of more than 150 million taxi trips by MIT, GE, and Audi in 2014. That project revealed that the total number of taxi trips could be easily decreased by 40% if taxi-sharing services existed. These findings and others provide key insights into highly effective routes to minimizing traffic and increasing urban efficiency. Moreover, since they rely heavily on real information as opposed to general urban theory, they may be more likely to succeed.Smart Infrastructure: Barcelona, SpainPopulation: 1.6 millionImage Credit: Business InsiderBarcelona is an economic and cultural powerhouse in Europe. Believe it or not, the city has been building smart city infrastructure for over 150 years. In 1854, Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s government mandated the destruction of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s city walls and sought to expand the city\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly growing population. Ildefons Cerda, an urban planner and civil engineer, heeded the call for expansion. He developed one of most prominent smart urban plans in history: the superblock.Serving as an octagonal mold for urban fabric, the superblock prioritizes large interior courtyards, wide streets, and buildings that recede from intersections to increase the amount of light entering the city\xe2\x80\x94a stark contrast to the dark and tightly interwoven streets of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s historical center. Additionally, by standardizing larger urban forms but allowing for differences in individual building design, the superblock has created a unique identity for Barcelona, allowing it to be visually interesting but not confusingly read as a cohesive whole.Jumping ahead, today\xe2\x80\x99s Barcelona has continued its legacy of infrastructural innovation. Building on top of the superblock network, which consists of horizontal and vertical grids intersected by multiple diagonal boulevards, Barcelona has recently deployed an orthogonal bus network. Highly-efficient\xc2\xa0hybrid buses repeatedly follow straight paths so that the network can allow passengers to minimize the complexity of their routes. Each rider can\xc2\xa0reach any destination with only one transfer.In 2002, Barcelona rolled out another key innovation that has minimized resource use. Districlima\xc2\xa0is an urban network of district-wide heating and cooling systems. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to what is in use at many American college campuses, albeit\xc2\xa0at a smaller scale. By providing steam as well as hot and cold water at a city-wide level, Districlima is able to implement environmental best practices such as using waste heat from industrial processes to create steam and leveraging plentiful sea-water for cooling. Districlima saves more than 17,500 tons of C02 annually and reduces fossil fuel consumption by 60%.Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhoods have also begun to experiment with another important infrastructural pursuit: smart waste management. Some neighborhoods have constructed large subterranean vacuum networks to minimize both the stench of overflowing dumpsters and the sound of trash collection vehicles. Other neighborhoods have partnered with companies to develop specialized sensors that alert waste management services when trash bins fill to a preset level. Those partnerships actively minimize the need for trash collection crews to waste resources by emptying trash bins that still have capacity. By allowing for exploration through small pilots in different neighborhoods, Barcelona will build an understanding of best practices that it can deploy across the larger population.Smart Governance:Tallinn, EstoniaPopulation: 426,500Image Credit: Wikimedia CommonsWhen the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Estonia regained its independence and was forced to reboot as a country with few resources. Estonia hoped to jumpstart the process of rebuilding by piggybacking on the internet boom in 1996. The nation quickly invested in a project called \xe2\x80\x9cTiger\xe2\x80\x99s Leap,\xe2\x80\x9d which rolled out computers with internet access to all schools and universities. In 2000, armed with a computationally savvy populace, Estonia\xe2\x80\x99s government led the world by declaring internet access a basic human right. The government began rolling out \xe2\x80\x9ce-Estonia\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94a suite of tools that would fully digitize the country\xe2\x80\x99s government.Anchored by X-Road\xe2\x80\x94an interoperable data service that allows the nation\xe2\x80\x99s e-service databases to link up harmoniously with private citizens and companies\xe2\x80\x94e-Estonia positions the nation at the forefront of digital governance. Since 2001, Estonians have been able to file their taxes online. 95% of the country does so today. In 2002, Estonia introduced high-tech e-ID cards paired with digital identities. These identities allow the government to authenticate citizens without physical contact, allowing for online voting, schooling, and protection as well as higher security banking. Since it began its reboot in 1991, Estonia has managed to put 99% of its government services online. (Marriage, divorce, and real estate transactions are still handled in person.)Digitization has enabled the Estonian government to operate 24 hours a day while maximizing the efficiency of taxpayer dollars. To keep citizen data safe, e-Estonia has become an early adopter of blockchain, which the government is integrating across its entire suite of tools. The government already authenticates property registries, business licenses, and judicial actions through blockchain technology.\xc2\xa0Given the level of personal data protection the government offers, Estonians can also have full access to their health data online without fear. They can seamlessly transfer between doctors and access digital prescriptions. World leaders like the USA lag far behind such a deep integration of useful technology into government practice.In the age of cyber-warfare, Estonia has also embarked on a mission to create the world\xe2\x80\x99s first \xe2\x80\x9cData Embassy,\xe2\x80\x9d which will contain a complete backup of the country\xe2\x80\x99s citizens and data in Luxembourg. For a small country of only 1.3 million people (including e-Citizens), Estonia has managed to successfully prepare itself for our rapidly changing times. Since data privacy and e-Services were designed and built from the ground up\xe2\x80\x94instead of through piecemeal replacement of pre-existing infrastructures\xe2\x80\x94Estonia is better positioned to adopt developing technologies than most other nations.While individual smart city deployments will (hopefully) be tailored to their specific contexts, the general frameworks and methods used when developing smart city solutions are highly transferable. Industrial, governmental, and\xc2\xa0public stakeholders alike will benefit from sharing learnings and best practices across cities and nations. Together, we can collaboratively push each other toward a better iteration of modern urban life.TweetShareShareEmailTAGSbig datadatadigital transformationinternet of thingsiotmarc bielasp3pppsmart buildingsmart citysmart city seriessmart energysmart homessmart meterssmart officeMarc Bielashttp://marcbielas.com/Marc Bielas is a Product Manager at Leverege.

The Reality Is More Complicated.ImageA worker power-washing the pedestrian plaza along Broadway in Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s garment district. Trash, used needles and feces there have drawn complaints.CreditCreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesBy Winnie HuNov. 13, 2018Office workers sip coffee beside men sleeping in chairs pulled together. Tourists park their shopping bags where people shoot up heroin, or drink until they pass out. Panhandlers go table to table seeking handouts. Piles of trash, used needles and worse (human feces) have drawn complaints.This is a scene from the heart of Manhattan, where a painstaking effort to ban cars and carve a public plaza out of one of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s most famous streets \xe2\x80\x94 with birch trees, cafe-style tables and original artwork \xe2\x80\x94 has collided with stark socioeconomic realities.An opioid epidemic has left some addicted and desperate. Others with mental illnesses are not getting the help they need. And of the more than 60,000 homeless people in New York, at least 3,000 live on the streets.The plaza along Broadway, a few blocks south of Times Square, has become a haven for people struggling with all of those issues.What is happening in Midtown Manhattan underscores the challenges in New York and many other American cities of creating public spaces that, by definition, are open to all and a cornerstone of urban life, especially in space-starved communities. From pocket-size parks to plazas on reclaimed roadways to sidewalks dressed up with sleek benches and kiosks, the spaces make concrete-and-asphalt grids more inviting.But as these public spaces have proliferated, they have also become testing grounds for what is acceptable \xe2\x80\x94 and unacceptable \xe2\x80\x94 public behavior. Cities including Honolulu, San Francisco, Colorado Springs and Charleston, S.C., have passed laws or regulations against sitting or lying down on sidewalks. Some cities have banned people from camping or even sleeping in public spaces.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a big issue for the people who manage public spaces in virtually every city in the country, and depending on what the rules and laws are, it\xe2\x80\x99s an almost intractable problem in most cases,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian Benepe, a senior vice president for the Trust for Public Land, and a former New York City parks commissioner.Many city and business leaders say setting basic rules of conduct helps ensure that public spaces can be enjoyed by everyone and addresses public health and safety concerns. Advocates for the homeless counter that such measures are unconstitutional, target the homeless and keep out people who have nowhere else to go.\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to tell me I can\xe2\x80\x99t use a public space because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a home?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason Flores, 30, who moved to New York from Philadelphia and sleeps in public areas because he has no money.Mr. Benepe said that behavior in public spaces has to be regulated, but that cities \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t criminalize homelessness and it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine line.\xe2\x80\x9dIn a 2016 survey of 187 cities, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that 88 cities had passed laws or regulations that restricted sitting or lying down in public places, up from 58 cities a decade earlier. Similar bans restricted sleeping in public spaces in 84 cities and begging in public spaces in 164 cities. It is unclear, however, how much these are enforced.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is being driven by the growth of homelessness and the increasing public presence of people who are poor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Foscarinis, the center\xe2\x80\x99s executive director, who added that some laws have been successfully challenged in the courts.ImagePlazas, including this one in Union Square in Manhattan, have proliferated across New York as officials have tried to make streets more welcoming to pedestrians.CreditYana Paskova for The New York TimesLaws trying to dictate behavior in public spaces, Ms. Foscarinis said, are a \xe2\x80\x9ckneejerk political reaction\xe2\x80\x9d that fail to address the underlying causes. She cited research showing that it would be more effective and less expensive to create affordable housing and provide social services than to enforce such laws.Jerold S. Kayden, an urban planning professor at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, said that as long as there have been public spaces, there have been tensions over who used them, and how. The agora in ancient Greece \xe2\x80\x94 a space for assembly celebrated for its debates \xe2\x80\x94 was originally only open to \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kayden said, in effect excluding \xe2\x80\x9cpeople not considered worthy of public space.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cPublic space has always been part of being human,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge: What expression of humanity is acceptable?\xe2\x80\x9dMr. Flores said security officers and others wake him up \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes three or four times a night \xe2\x80\x94 and tell him to move on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like being kicked when you\xe2\x80\x99re down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair.\xe2\x80\x9dBut also unfair, others said, is having public spaces taken over by those seeking a place to sleep or making it harder for others to use.Constantine Obelenus, 65, a messenger, recalled not having a place to sit with a cup of coffee in a park near his home in Elmhurst, Queens, because the benches were taken by people sleeping. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the space for?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody.\xe2\x80\x9dSidewalks have become contentious as well. In Manhattan, residents of a Chelsea apartment building have cleaned mounds of trash, rotting food, urine in juice bottles, feces and used needles left outside their door by people who camp out on the pavement.Mark Goldey, 49, a lawyer who lives in the building, said the LinkNYC kiosks, which offer free internet access, at either end of his block are another problem because people sprawl out around them with their stuff and block foot traffic.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get around,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels unsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d[How New York City has taken streets away from cars to turn into pedestrian plazas]New York City has long had rules for how public spaces are to be used. Some of the most stringent apply to city parks and playgrounds, where more than three dozen rules prohibit a range of conduct, such as disorderly behavior, urinating, defecating, fighting, spitting, lying down on benches, camping without a permit and not picking up after dogs.Park officers handed out 1,820 tickets for all violations through August, compared with 1,850 all of last year.Other public spaces resort to creative ways of curbing unwanted behavior. Metal dividers are added to benches to keep people from lying down. Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan is \xe2\x80\x9cprogrammed within an inch of its life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 festivals, readings, ice-skating \xe2\x80\x94 to bring in crowds that leave little room for illicit uses, said Dan Biederman, the president of the Bryant Park Corporation, which manages the park.But sidewalks and streets were never intended as gathering places. That changed when pedestrian plazas were carved out of streets. In 2016, New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation adopted rules for its pedestrian plazas \xe2\x80\x94 59 are open, 18 more are on the way \xe2\x80\x94 after complaints of costumed Elmos and other vendors aggressively seeking tips in the Times Square plaza.ImageJason Flores, 30, said he sleeps in public areas in Manhattan because he has no money.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe rules are now posted in every plaza, but are often ignored or flouted, according to plaza managers and others. Because plazas \xe2\x80\x94 unlike parks \xe2\x80\x94 never close, they can be an open invitation for misconduct and there are no dedicated officers to enforce the rules, they said. The police have to be called.After a sprawling Bronx plaza opened in 2016, homeless people and others sought refuge there, bringing mattresses and suitcases. Drug use is also common there.\xe2\x80\x9cYou just have this open space inviting people to do whatever they want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilma Alonso, the executive director of the Fordham Road Business Improvement District. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has so much potential that when it\xe2\x80\x99s empty and underutilized, it hurts.\xe2\x80\x9dJust south of there, in a popular South Bronx shopping district known as the Hub, at least 50 people at any time \xe2\x80\x94 or more than three times as many as a year ago \xe2\x80\x94 sleep or camp out in public spaces, including a recently opened plaza, said Michael Brady, the executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. Mr. Brady said his staff and local business owners have learned to give a nasal spray used to treat overdoses.Under state law, homeless people cannot be forcibly removed from the streets unless they pose a threat to themselves or others. City officials said they have significantly expanded outreach efforts and programs for the homeless. They said they have helped nearly 2,000 people voluntarily leave the streets for shelters and permanent housing since 2016.The Broadway plaza is the largest public space in Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s garment district, a dense neighborhood where factories have been replaced with offices, restaurants, hotels and apartments. At night, as many as two dozen people sleep on the plaza where festive white lights will soon be strung for the holidays and silver tables and chairs offer \xe2\x80\x94 weather permitting \xe2\x80\x94 al fresco dining amid skyscrapers.Several men said they felt safe there, with the huge planters of juniper and Japanese holly offering shelter from the cold. J.R., 36, who declined to give his full name, said he was homeless and slept there only at night when office workers were not around.In the daytime, he said, he tried not to bother anyone. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone should try to be fair with each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to share the space.\xe2\x80\x9dBut other people argue and fight in the plaza, according to workers for the Garment District Alliance, which maintains the plaza. These workers say they have seen people use and sell drugs, and urinate on the plants. One rowdy group recently pelted passers-by with batteries, they said.Min Park, the manager of Cook Eatery, said some people from the plaza have grabbed food from the deli\xe2\x80\x99s buffet table without paying. Or they have asked customers for money. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m constantly chasing them out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Barbara A. Blair, the alliance\xe2\x80\x99s president, has stationed security guards around the plaza to try to keep the peace. She once posted signs asking people not to give money to panhandlers on the plaza. The signs were ripped down. She got emails accusing her of being heartless.At 5 a.m. on a recent day, Ms. Blair accompanied security officers as they woke people sleeping on the plaza to tell them that it was being cleaned. Outreach workers with Urban Pathways, a nonprofit, offered support services and a place for them to stay. Then six cleaners came with power hoses and disinfectant.\xe2\x80\x9cWe love our plaza,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Blair said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re struggling with homelessness and antisocial behavior in these public spaces.\xe2\x80\x9dA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Havens in Cramped Cities Test the Concept of Public Space for All.

Quayside represents a joint effort by the Canadian government agency Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company Alphabet Inc., to develop\xc2\xa012 acres of the valuable waterfront just southeast of downtown Toronto.\nIn keeping with the utopian rhetoric that fuels the development of so much digital infrastructure, Sidewalk Labs has pitched Quayside as the solution to everything from traffic congestion and rising housing prices to environmental pollution. The proposal for Quayside includes a centralized identity management system, through which \xe2\x80\x9ceach resident accesses public services\xe2\x80\x9d such as library cards and health care. An applicant for a position at Sidewalk Labs in Toronto was shocked when he was\xc2\xa0asked in an interview to imagine how, in a smart city, \xe2\x80\x9cvoting might be different in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOther, comparatively quaint plans include driverless cars, \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-use\xe2\x80\x9d spaces that change according to the market\xe2\x80\x99s demands, heated streets, and \xe2\x80\x9csensor-enabled waste separation.\xe2\x80\x9d The eventual aim of Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99s estimated billion-dollar investment is to bring these innovations to scale \xe2\x80\x94 first to more than 800 acres on the city\xe2\x80\x99s eastern waterfront, and then to the world at large. \xe2\x80\x9cThe genesis of the thinking for Sidewalk Labs came from Google\xe2\x80\x99s founders getting excited thinking of \xe2\x80\x98all the things you could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d explained Eric Schmidt, Google\xe2\x80\x99s former executive chair, when Quayside was first announced.\nFrom the start, activists, technology researchers, and some government officials have been skeptical about the idea of putting Google, or one of its sister companies, in charge of a city. Their suspicions about turning part of Toronto into a corporate test bed were triggered, at first, by the company\xe2\x80\x99s history of unethical corporate practices and surreptitious data collection. They have since been borne out by Quayside\xe2\x80\x99s secret and undemocratic development process, which has been plagued by a lack of public input \xe2\x80\x94 what one critic has called \xe2\x80\x9ca colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues.\xe2\x80\x9d In recent months, a series of prominent resignations from advisory board members, along with organized resistance from concerned residents, have added to the growing public backlash against the project.\nA few weeks ago, Ann Cavoukian, one of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s leading privacy experts and Ontario\xe2\x80\x99s former privacy commissioner, became the latest stakeholder to resign from the project. Cavoukian was brought on by Sidewalk Toronto (as the collaboration between Waterfront Toronto and Google-sibling Sidewalk Labs is known) as a consultant to help institute a proactive, \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy by design\xe2\x80\x9d framework. She was initially told that all data collected from residents would be deleted and rendered unidentifiable. Cavoukian learned last month, however, that third parties would be able to access identifiable information gathered at Quayside. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagined us creating a Smart City of Privacy, as opposed to a Smart City of Surveillance,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Cavoukian\xc2\xa0wrote\xc2\xa0in her resignation letter. Her concerns echoed those of residents who have long pointed to the privacy implications of handing over streets to the world\xe2\x80\x99s most profitable data hoover.\nIn response to questions from The Intercept about Cavoukian\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, a spokesperson for Sidewalk Labs said,\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSidewalk Labs has committed to implement, as a company, the principles of Privacy by Design. Though that question is settled, the question of whether other companies involved in the Quayside project would be required to do so is unlikely to be worked out soon, and may be out of Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow, in an effort to get ahead of\xc2\xa0Quayside\xe2\x80\x99s development before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late, a coalition of experts and residents have launched a Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum. The group represents the latest and largest effort by Torontonians to start having the kinds of public conversations, teach-ins, and debates that should have \xe2\x80\x9ctaken place last year, when this project was first announced,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Bianca Wylie, co-founder of Tech Reset Canada and one of the lead organizers of the opposition to Sidewalk Toronto. \xe2\x80\x9cThe process Sidewalk Toronto has started has been so anti-democratic that the only way to participate is to be proactive in framing the topic,\xe2\x80\x9d Wylie continued.\nToronto Open Smart Cities Forum is taking the lead in the local fight against the commodification of its city\xe2\x80\x99s data. The group\xe2\x80\x99s struggle is one that urban residents around the world have been watching closely. Even those who never set foot in Canada may soon be subject to the products, norms, and techniques produced by Sidewalk Toronto, simply by virtue of using Google\xe2\x80\x99s earth-spanning services. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about data being sold,\xe2\x80\x9d Wylie said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also about how is this data being used with other kinds of data in other products. You can move a lot of information around within Alphabet without having to sell it, and we need to talk about that.\xe2\x80\x9d The outcome of Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s ability to rein in the Google affiliate, in other words, has ramifications not just for Canadians, but also for the future of who controls our civic life.\nConceptual image of Sidewalk Toronto.\nImage: Sidewalk Toronto\nA City of Surveillance\nSidewalk Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing controversies may serve as the latest warning sign for cities who are considering signing over public spaces to major tech companies. Cavoukian\xe2\x80\x99s decision to quit represents only the most recent resignation in a series of departures that Wylie has referred to as an \xe2\x80\x9congoing bulldozing of stakeholders.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to Cavoukian, a Waterfront Toronto\xc2\xa0board member and two Waterfront Toronto\xc2\xa0digital\xc2\xa0advisers have also resigned in the last five months. Three more digital advisers have also\xc2\xa0threatened to resign unless major changes are made to the project\xe2\x80\x99s planning process.\nIn anticipation of the negative press, Sidewalk Labs has allocated $11 million of its initial $50 million budget to \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications/engagement/and public relations.\xe2\x80\x9d This includes a strategy of building influencers \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure support for the Master Innovation and Development Plan among key constituents in Toronto.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Last week, iPolitics\xc2\xa0reported that Sidewalk Labs has begun lobbying at least\xc2\xa019 federal departments, including the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s office, Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Treasury Board, among others. The meetings all took place days after the resignation of Cavoukian, the former Ontario privacy commissioner.\nBut so far, the project has been losing allies more quickly than it\xe2\x80\x99s been making them. When Saadia Muzaffar, a prominent technologist and the founder of TechGirls Canada, resigned from Waterfront Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Strategy Advisory Panel in October, it was due in part to the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cblatant disregard for resident concerns about data and digital infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d In her viral letter of resignation, Muzaffar criticized Sidewalk Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s dishonest negotiations process: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing innovative about city-building that disenfranchises its residents in insidious ways and robs valuable earnings out of public budgets, or commits scarce public funds to the ongoing maintenance of technology that city leadership has not even declared a need for.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf Google\xe2\x80\x99s other global projects are any indication, Sidewalk Lab\xe2\x80\x99s venture in Canada\xc2\xa0may hew closely to the Silicon Valley model of offering free services in exchange for the right to virtually limitless data collection. Sidewalk Labs-associated LinkNYC and InLinkUK kiosks have already been installed in New York and London. The kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 which include three cameras,\xc2\xa030 sensors, and Bluetooth beacons \xe2\x80\x94 aggregate anonymized data for advertising purposes in exchange for providing passersby with free Wi-Fi services.\nGiven that there is no genuine way to opt out of public space, Torontonians have been asking questions about what meaningful consent would look like. In the case of Quayside, the terms of any agreement\xc2\xa0wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just cover Wi-Fi but could also extend to basic government services. Julie Di Lorenzo, a real estate developer who left Waterfront\xe2\x80\x99s board in July, explained to the AP that questions she had asked about residents who might not consent to share data had gone unanswered. She wanted to know if those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t opt-in to the city would be told that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live there. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to willingly install Alexa in your home,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Toronto journalist Brian Barth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s another when publicly owned infrastructure \xe2\x80\x94 streets, bridges, parks and plazas \xe2\x80\x94 is Alexa, so to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdding to these concerns is the fact that Sidewalk Labs has asked potential local consultants to hand over all of their intellectual property, according to a recent Globe and Mail investigation. As Jim Balsillie, the former CEO of Blackberry, recently pointed out in an\xc2\xa0op-ed, Waterfront Toronto has left the ownership of intellectual property\xc2\xa0and data unresolved in its latest agreement; this means that it would default to Sidewalk Labs, giving the company a gross market advantage. Indeed, in an\xc2\xa0announcement last year, Schmidt went as far as to thank Canadian taxpayers for creating some of Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s key artificial intelligence technology, the\xc2\xa0intellectual property of which the company now owns. Balsillie noted that what happens in Toronto will \xe2\x80\x9chave profound and permanent impacts on the digital rights and prosperity of all Canadians because IP [intellectual property] and data \xe2\x80\x94 our century\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable extractive resources \xe2\x80\x94 spread seamlessly.\xe2\x80\x9d This is why current and former stakeholders in Waterfront Toronto have called for the public to receive financial benefits from the project, emphasizing that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s largest city should not simply be seen as a U.S. company\xe2\x80\x99s urban laboratory.\nThe Sidewalk Labs spokesperson said that\xc2\xa0the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelationship with its contractors does not impact its agreements with Waterfront Toronto in any way, including its commitment to the process laid out in the PDA,\xc2\xa0which says that in the future Waterfront Toronto may have rights to certain Sidewalk Labs IP. Of course, if Sidewalk Labs does not own the IP created by the planning process, it would not have the power to share or convey that IP to Waterfront Toronto or anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9dJoin Our NewsletterOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.I\xe2\x80\x99m inYet until recently, Sidewalk Labs refused to say who will own data produced by Quayside\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, workers, and residents in what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe most measurable community in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Nor had the company clarified, despite facing pointed questions at public town hall-style meetings, whether or how the information streaming in from sensors in park benches, traffic lights, and dumpsters would be monetized. (The writer Evgeny Morozov has summed up Google\xe2\x80\x99s strategy as \xe2\x80\x9cNow everything is permitted \xe2\x80\x93 unless somebody complains.\xe2\x80\x9d)\nIn an apparent response to the mounting public pressure against the project, Sidewalk Labs recently released its first proposal for the digital governance of its collected data. Most significant among these plans was the suggestion that all data be placed in a \xe2\x80\x9ccivic data trust.\xe2\x80\x9d On the company\xe2\x80\x99s blog, Alyssa Harvey Dawson, Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 Head of Data Governance, explained that with the proposed creation of a civic data trust, no one would have the \xe2\x80\x9cright to own information collected from Quayside\xe2\x80\x99s physical environment \xe2\x80\x94 including Sidewalk Labs.\xe2\x80\x9d This would represent, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9ca new standard for responsible data use that protects personal privacy and the public interest while enabling companies, researchers, innovators, governments, and civic organizations to improve urban life using urban data.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to experts who have been following the project closely, the details of how this trust might be implemented are vague and at times contradictory. On one hand, the proposal states that Sidewalk Labs would get no\xc2\xa0preferential\xc2\xa0access to any data that is collected. On the other, as Sean McDonald points out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proposed trust would grant licenses to collect and use data \xe2\x80\x94 and the more sensitive the data, the more proprietary it would be.\xe2\x80\x9d There is also the question of just how\xc2\xa0anonymous certain data would be, and whether such\xc2\xa0anonymity would be reversible when it came to sharing information with law enforcement. Some residents are opposed to Sidewalk Labs having any involvement with this data proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is as if Uber were to propose regulations on ride-sharing, or Airbnb were to tell city council how to govern short-term rentals. By definition, there is a conflict of interest,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Nabeel Ahmed, a smart city expert and member of the Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum.\nPart of the mission of the new Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum is to shift the public conversation away from debating the latest minutiae of the company\xe2\x80\x99s proposed terms and toward a broader consideration of whether the project should move forward under any terms at all. This conversation, Wylie emphasizes, should be taking place between residents and the government; Sidewalk Labs should not be the only voice setting the terms and advancing the agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to state clearly and unambiguously that this infrastructure is public,\xe2\x80\x9d Wylie said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say in March, \xe2\x80\x98This data isn\xe2\x80\x99t being collected,\xe2\x80\x99 but then in July, it\xe2\x80\x99s updated to do something else. This infrastructure creates plausible surveillance so long as you always keep the door open to what\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xe2\x80\x9dWe depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

Richter is the CEO and Co-Founder of Soofa. While at MIT, she worked with municipalities in South Africa, Japan, China and Europe on smart transportation systems in collaboration with companies like Volkswagen, Lockheed Martin, and Verizon to define smart city strategies and evaluate business models. She co-founded Soofa in 2014 to deploy smart, social, and sustainable city technology in neighborhoods all around the world\nNov 14, 2018 | Governance, Technology | 1 comment\nI challenge you to become a great smart city catalyst. To transform your community by democratizing access to technology, adapting to your communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs, and learning from your mistakes. Cities are investing in housing, business, transportation, and technology to turn our urban centers into smart places that can cope with unprecedented growth. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one element at the heart of great urban leadership that is often overlooked: driving civic engagement. At Soofa, we think that the result of successful civic engagement is the betterment of the quality of life for all people in all communities in a city. This happens not necessarily through political processes, rather; through regular, two way communication between city leaders and citizens. For over a decade, I have worked with leaders in government, real estate, and business. Soofa has installed smart urban devices in over 120 cities around the world, and along the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve met countless people and have seen the diverse neighborhoods they build.\xc2\xa0I have travelled from Europe to the US, worked in China, Japan, and Africa, and have always followed the MIT Media Labs\xe2\x80\x99 principles, which guide our vision at Soofa and have shaped our own principles to enhance civic engagement. The challenge of creating a culture of civic engagement can be daunting. Our strategy to overcome this challenge has been crystalized in a number of design principles for success\xe2\x80\x94among them a flexible engagement platform that everyone, in every neighborhood, can access. Here are the key elements that define Soofa\xe2\x80\x99s approach to successful civic engagement using technology. \xc2\xa0 1. Make it Easy to Engage Constituents: Provide a Democratized, Easy, and Fun Way for Humans to Promote the Quality of Life in their Community Online and Offline. Giving a voice to a city, its people, and its businesses is what makes a smart city catalyst truly great and their city fully engaged. Studies show when community members are involved, contributing to the discourse, and acting as owners of change, their community thrives. We need to make it easy to engage online and offline and support catalysts from all neighborhoods, regardless of demographic or socioeconomic status. For a long time, \xe2\x80\x9ccivic engagement\xe2\x80\x9d meant going to community meetings: meetings with long agendas and few action items taking place in the middle of the day. Having participated in many of these meetings, I noticed the attendees are rarely representative of the community, and in particular, my generation of younger people is underrepresented. Some community leaders reacted to the lack of millennial involvement by sharing information and seeking public opinion on social networks, like sponsoring surveys on Facebook, engaging in dialogue on Twitter, or promoting specialized websites like CoUrbanize\xc2\xa0to facilitate community discussions and encourage democratized decision-making and action. Public engagement and influence have gone from personal, door-to-door interactions and neighborhood gatherings in a rec center or library to television advertisements to social media. The next generation engages in neighborhood politics with 280 characters and an emoji. While new platforms make it easy to participate, they also make it easy to tune out, and community members who aren\xe2\x80\x99t tech savvy or don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to the Internet are left out. This means we still face the same problems with new technology as we do with community meetings\xe2\x80\x94not everyone is heard and not everyone can engage. Good city leaders know this and communicate across multiple platforms online and offline. Posters and bulletin board ads, when well-designed, do capture my attention\xe2\x80\x94but more often than not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get excited about the message only to realize it\xe2\x80\x99s for an event that has already happened. With the rise of social media and the ability to easily create event ads online, our public communication surfaces are not kept up-to-date\xe2\x80\x94and while accessible to all, flyers taped to every telephone pole litter our cities. The right mix of communications that link to citizens\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives to the futures they wish to create is key in a smart city. This includes both real people speaking to the community as well as mass communication on- and offline that can still be personalized and relevant for diverse audiences. As we think through city-wide communication strategy, we need to embrace and demand more digital surfaces in our cities, because they have the potential to reach and engage all citizens in the moment with the right message. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get serious about communication and marketing at the city level and invest in multi-channel civic engagement. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take back the billboards at our bus stops and use them to share messages about our neighborhoods. Let\xe2\x80\x99s regain a sense of ownership of the information we see when we wait for the subway and take advantage of the time our citizens are most engaged and captive\xe2\x80\x94sharing with them relevant, civically engaging content instead of one advertisement after the next.\nLearn more about bringing the Soofa Sign to your community.\nMore info\n2. Adapt to the Neighborhood: \xc2\xa0Be Humble, Listen, and Understand That There is No Cookie-Cutter Solution. The idea of multi-channel civic engagement and the role of the grassroots community marketer is being implemented by forward-thinking smart city leaders who understand the \xc2\xa0importance\xe2\x80\x94and economic benefits\xe2\x80\x94of giving their constituents a voice. More investments are being made into digital systems that reach and engage the public. Services like 311 are now app store-ready (like we see in Atlanta), amber alerts are pushed to all smart phones across the nation, and civic messages engaging the public are being pushed through new offline digital display networks. These systems are expensive to build, implement, and maintain. In the spirit of scalability and cost optimization\xe2\x80\x94both key features of a successful, sustainable smart city\xe2\x80\x94the digital infrastructure both for real-world and cloud-based applications is being standardized. The same is true for messaging when resources are tight. This is problematic for diverse communities and urban landscapes where the vibe and demographic composition changes from block to block. The installation of LinkNYC (digital kiosks) in New York City was a success in some neighborhoods, but was received with skepticism in others. Millions of dollars were spent to give citizens access to information, WiFi, and a voice\xe2\x80\x94but instead, they got a loud, bright platform reserved for national advertisers and misused services. As much as it was hoped that the content would be different for every neighborhood, relevant to the audience it was being served to, it often has ended up that broad messages and irrelevant advertisements blanketed the network. Not everywhere is Times Square, but often every neighborhood is seeing the same content being shown there. Soofa designs low-cost systems that are simple to deploy and have few, yet highly-demanded features. This is true for applications we build as well as for our technology-enabled infrastructure. We take a neighborhood-by-neighborhood or group-by-group approach and make time to listen to and implement feedback, allowing for the true customization our communities need. \xc2\xa0 3. Prototype, Learn from your Mistakes, and Think Through the Long-Term Financial Impact. This is more than a principle; it should be a pledge by all city leaders, industry partners, and everyone involved in making great cities around the world. Share experiences and learn from each other. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overthink, don\xe2\x80\x99t overbuild, always test, and iterate quickly. Great smart city leaders might have a grand vision, but they must work collaboratively and bring their community along for the journey. This creates supporters who feel empowered and leaders who are trusted to make the change we want to see and experience. I am often shocked by the budgets for planning civic engagement processes that are often years long and result in a thousand-page report that gets filed away in the dark recesses of city hall storage cabinets. Reports and plans play well with the risk aversion that is often found in city halls, but if when we don\xe2\x80\x99t act, these reports and plans live and die with a single administration. When adding tech into the equation, we think easy and cheap. But a good social media strategy that reaches everyone takes talent, time, iterative development, and lots of funding. Civic apps like 311 need to be maintained, and large kiosks are in the hundred thousand-dollar range for a single unit. Who is going to pay for that? Too often the answer is advertisers and sponsors. Advertisement and sponsorship can be a great way to support the public, but we need to be aware of the advertisers\xe2\x80\x99 intentions and remember to finance low-income neighborhood engagement as well as the bustling downtown streets and squares. The digital divide will only be worsened if we focus on social media strategy for those who have Internet access and advertising-supported digital outdoor platforms that are attractive in neighborhoods where the demographics and traffic volume appeal to advertisers. This is where a platform like the Soofa Sign\xe2\x80\x94solar-powered, affordable, and flexible\xe2\x80\x94meets the needs of cities large and small and benefits everyone from the most affluent neighborhoods to those in transition. As smart city leaders and changemakers, I ask you to always remember\xc2\xa0to put people first and technology second. Citizen engagement is always evolving; there are always new tools and methods. First and foremost, though, smart cities need stewardship and maintenance. They need leaders who work hard to understand the needs of all people and build trust through collaboration and iteration. Someone needs to pay to make even the simplest of smart city visions real, and we need a sustainable business model that can scale to meet the grandest vision. Our cities deserve less paperwork, less bureaucracy, and more courage.\nDiscussion Leave your comment below, or reply to others.\n1 Comment\nAndrew M Manshel\non November 14, 2018 at 7:52 am\nHappy to chat with you over coffee any time.

This results in $53 million in sales tax per square mile, compared to the citywide average of $5 million. Not to mention that downtown residential buildings also add to the tax base. In the 24 cities included in the study, residential growth in these downtowns outpaced the rest of the city by 400% between 2010 and 2016. Partnerships between city officials and contractors result in new and visionary downtown destinations. Along with large vertical construction projects, there are opportunities for countless other projects, including parking structures, enhanced Wi-Fi, landscaping, pedestrian and biking paths, and traffic improvements.\nThe Future of Cities\nby Dr. Nikos A. Salingaros Ordered city geometry that is built today is meaningless for energy cycles. Resilient networks contain inherent diversity and redundancy, with optimal cooperation among their subsystems, yet they avoid optimization (maximum efficiency) for any single process. They require continuous input of energy in order to function, with energy cycles running simultaneously on many different scales. Short-term urban fixes only wish to perpetuate the extractive model of cities, not to correct its underlying long-term fragility!\nShowing Results Will Win More Funding for Transit Projects\nby Paul Mackie TDM, when employed, works. TDM agencies around the country use a treasure\xe2\x80\x99s trove of strategies to get people out of cars and onto trains, buses, and bikes, which is something that has to happen if we don\xe2\x80\x99t want our roads to become unusable due to traffic and environmental congestion. But one major problem with the practice of TDM is that it has had a hard time making the case that it is a cost-effective alternative or at least add-on to big infrastructure projects. It seems pretty obvious that teaching people, educating them, about how to use our systems will make those systems run more smoothly. But there has never been a great way to back up that assumption with hard numbers.\nMeeting of the Minds is made possible by the generous support of these organizations.\nJoin our email list to keep up-to-date with our events and resources.We bring\xc2\xa0together leaders from multiple sectors and diverse geographies to share ideas and work together to shape a common urban agenda.

The targeting tactics are based around things like calls to action for delivery, around lunchtime, near office towers.\nNo real revelation here, but the ease of doing this is in many respects tied to how much data a network has about the specific screen location, and what\xe2\x80\x99s around it. With the right rules-based scheduling engine, the targeting could get a lot more granular than this.\nBioTwitterLinkedInLatest Posts\nDave HaynesEditor/Founder at Sixteen:NineDave Haynes is the founder and editor of Sixteen:Nine, an online publication that has followed the digital signage industry for more than 12 years.

They were given these certifications for 2017. Now for the first time, What Works Cities has published its certification criteria for 2018, doing so in a\xc2\xa0post on medium.\nIn addition to laying out a ton of specific and useful information for cities, the post also notes that \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Works Cities Certification is the standard of excellence for data-driven local government. The program\xe2\x80\x99s 45 criteria outline the people, processes, and policies foundational to a well-managed city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRELATEDWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: Can Alaska Help Solve Climate Change?What\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: Civic Technologists Work to Educate, Mobilize VotersWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New in Civic Tech: New Directory Maps the Top Civic Innovation LabsThe relevant criteria are grouped into eight foundational practices, including data governance, evaluations, general management, open data, performance and analytics, repurposing, results-driven contracting, and stakeholder engagement.\nThis year\xe2\x80\x99s criteria is a revised and updated version of last year\xe2\x80\x99s. In 2017, more than 230 cities applied for this benchmarking program. To be eligible for 2018 certification, local governments must submit their assessments by Dec. 31, 2018. Click here for more information about What Works Cities Certification.\nNew York City Uses Kiosks to Showcase Historic Photos\nNew York City has launched a new program aimed at sharing more of its historic photographs with residents and visitors through a collaborative effort between its LinkNYC kiosks program and its Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT). The program is called Historic NYC and it brings historic photographs of New York\xe2\x80\x99s world-famous landmarks and streets to the Link kiosks spread throughout all five boroughs.\nAlso partnering on this program are the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) and Urban Archive. The photos are being provided by the museum while Urban Archive\xe2\x80\x99s mapping technology is making the location-based displaying possible within a couple hundred feet of where the individual photographs were first taken.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the new photography includes Staten Island\xe2\x80\x99s Richmond Club in 1895, the Forest Hills Inn in Queens from 1916, the Williamsburgh Savings Bank tower in Brooklyn in 1929, and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx from 1937. Links will feature the exact address at which the photo was taken, the distance from the Link showing the photo, as well as the photographer and the year the photograph was taken,\xe2\x80\x9d the city said in a press release.\nThis is a pretty noteworthy campaign, in that it expresses a truth about such kiosk programs, which have become popular in other major cities as well, and that truth is that there are many new and creative uses for this tech that have yet to be explored.\nClick here to see some of the photos.\nTrio of Major World Cities Form Coalition for Digital Rights\nIn other New York City news, the jurisdiction is teaming with Amsterdam and Barcelona to form a new coalition for digital rights.\nThe three cities have launched an effort dubbed Cities Coalition for Digital Rights, an initiative aimed at both promoting and tracking progress they are making toward better protecting the digital rights of residents of and visitors to their cities.\nThe idea is for this new coalition to help with the creation of things like policies, tools and resources that can advance burgeoning digital rights efforts. The group\xe2\x80\x99s work will also align with the Charter for Human Rights and Principles for the Internet, which was established by the UN\xe2\x80\x99s Internet Governance Forum.\nIn a press release this week, the cities noted this is the first time that cities have come together to protect digital rights on a global scale.\nThere are five shared principles at work, and organizers say they expect them to help set the agenda for policy discussions as well as with other cities in the future. The five principles are as follows:\nUniversal and equal access to the Internet, and digital literacy\nPrivacy, data protection and security\nTransparency, accountability, and non-discrimination of data, content and algorithm\nParticipatory democracy, diversity and inclusion\nOpen and ethical digital service standards\nFull details about all of this are available at https://citiesfordigitalrights.org.\nA Weekly Chicago Civic Tech Meetup Has Evolved into a Membership-based Nonprofit\nChi Hack Night, the prolific weekly Chicago-based civic tech meetup, has evolved into a membership-based nonprofit organization, the group has announced on its website.\nChi Hack Night co-founder Derek Eder detailed the changes in the post, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cin December 2018, Chi Hack Night will incorporate as an independent, membership-driven 501(c)3 non-profit organization. We will invite attendees to become voting members and elect who will serve on our Board of Directors. And on December 11th, we will hold a town hall feedback session about these changes at Chi Hack Night.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis marks a major evolution for Chi Hack Night, which has been running every Tuesday night in the city for roughly six and a half years, attracting notable attendees who have ranged from candidates for governor to employees of the city\xe2\x80\x99s tech and innovation department. In fact, before leaving city service, then-Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk attended all of the group\xe2\x80\x99s meetings.\nThe format for Chi Hack Night features food, speakers and time to invest in civic tech projects in various stages of completion. The group has a long resume of projects it has helped complete, with notable examples ranging from a website that provides easy access to lobbying data to a visualization of vacant buildings to an online snowplow tracker. Chi Hack Night has drawn interest from all levels of government, been featured in the Chicago Tribune and inspired copycat efforts as far away as Toronto.\nIncorporating as a nonprofit will essentially formalize the group moving from an ad hoc setup to one wherein decisions are made democratically by a more diverse leadership structure.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been running Chi Hack Night for almost seven years,\xe2\x80\x9d Eder wrote in his announcement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has grown beyond me. In order for Chi Hack Night to grow and sustain itself, I need to give up some of my power and distribute it to others. By spreading this power around, Chi Hack Night will become stronger and better equipped to inspire and promote civic engagement and technology.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOther Civic Tech News This Week:\nWhy Chicago Added a Design Office to City Hall\nBismarck, N.D.'s Mobile App Goes Live\nAccessibility a Key Focus of Lima, Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s New Website\nCity Council Defers to Feds, Tabling Drone Ordinance\nCalifornia Students Teach Coding to Kids in Shelters\nZack Quaintance\nAssistant News Editor\nZack Quaintance is the assistant news editor for Government Technology.

Talking to Light Reading after her appearance, she explained that the company is well aware of the possibility of using its public WiFi kiosks as street mountings for 5G small cells or repeaters. (See Bright Lights, Smart City: A \'Street Furniture\' Exploration.)\nJen Hensley, president of LinkNYC, describes the kiosks as "an endpoint that is going to be increasingly valuable over time," with 5G deployments a definite possibility in the future. The company is already talking with partners about the 5G prospects, she said. "We\'ve been at it a couple of years," she noted.\nQuestions about who would control any 5G small cells are still in play, while the city of New York would still have design rights over the "street furniture" to be deployed on the nine-and-a-half-foot tall kiosks.\nNonetheless, using the LinkNYC kiosks as 5G hosts would make sense for deployments in dense urban locales such as Manhattan. Each kiosk is served via a gigabit fiber connection already and the small cell could be powered at the source.\nThe kiosks could help address the range limitations of high-band 28GHz millimeter 5G, which operators have been testing at ranges of 1,000 to 2,000 feet for gigabit connectivity. (See 5G: The Density Question .)\nIn areas like midtown Manhattan, operators already use the kiosks to deploy at every block in many areas. LinkNYC is currently due to roll out 7,500 kiosks across the five boroughs, about five times the number deployed so far.\nLink President Jen Hensley discusses city connectivity with Light Reading\'s Alan Breznick.\nLinkNYC is backed by Google\n(Nasdaq: GOOG)\'s Intersection unit, Qualcomm Inc.\n(Nasdaq: QCOM) and QMX Smartscapes. Qualcomm has already announced plans to make mmWave small cell chipsets, expected to be available in commercial devices sometime around late 2020. (See Qualcomm & Samsung to Work on 5G Small Cells and Qualcomm Spills LinkNYC\'s Guts.).)\nLink is also expanding its footprint. As well as NYC, the operation is deploying kiosks in parts of Newark, NJ, and elsewhere. "We\'ve just started in Philly," Hensley noted. It also has 300 units deployed in the UK as LinkLondon. (See\nLinkNYC Now Live in All 5 Boroughs.)\n\xe2\x80\x94 Dan Jones, Mobile Editor, Light Reading\nLike what we have to say?

All across New York City, small businesses are hoping to get a piece of the action.\nWhile Black Friday conjures up images of long lines outside big-box stores and people fighting over televisions, local shops\xc2\xa0are working to get customers through the doors both on the big day, as well as Small Business Saturday.\n"This really kicks off the holiday season for us and it is usually one of our busiest days of the year," said\xc2\xa0Lexi Beach, who owns Astoria Bookshop, of Saturday. The mom-and-pop bookstore is participating in the neighborhood\'s Small Business Saturday Retail Crawl, in which customers get "passport" stamps for each participating store they visit and \xe2\x80\x94 if they collect five or more \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0can enter to win gift cards worth $450.\n"It\'s really festive," Beach said. "We\'ve found it to be really successful, and we love seeing the excitement of people who just love supporting local businesses."\nNicole Panettieri, owner The Brass Owl, a boutique in Astoria,\xc2\xa0organizes the retail crawl, now in its fourth year. Last year, more than 250 people turned in their "passports," she said. Eighteen businesses are participating in this year\'s crawl.\n"There\'s that nostalgic mentality for New Yorkers having mom-and-pop shops. People really love supporting the local businesses," Panettieri said. "All the owners here, because we live here, we really keep the neighborhood\'s best interest in mind when we\'re curating the shops."\nIn Brooklyn, the Atlantic Avenue Business Improvement District is doing a monthlong\xc2\xa0photo campaign running on a dozen LinkNYC kiosks in the borough\xc2\xa0starting Saturday, hoping to emphasize the personalities and faces behind some of the area\'s locally-owned shops.\n"It\'s not just about shopping for gifts. But the reason people go to these places and go back to them is the wonderful relationships people have, and we want to celebrate that," said\xc2\xa0Sara Nordmann, the executive director of the Atlantic Avenue BID. "I\xc2\xa0realize that shopping online has its appeals \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0it\'s convenient. You can\'t reason people out of it. [But] if they want to have a nice place to live with active street life, with people to say hello to, with something interesting to see .\xe2\x80\x82.\xe2\x80\x82. they need to make a commitment to brick-and-mortar and to the people behind it."\nGet Breaking News emails\nThe latest about your city, as it happens.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nKaren Zebulon, of the children\'s store Gumbo, is participating in the Atlantic Avenue BID\'s Small Business Saturday campaign. Photo Credit: Photomuse / Kristin Reimer\nEva Dayton, the founder of Consignment Brooklyn on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, hopes Friday and Saturday will be a big family shopping weekend. She is planning on giving away essential oil candles with a $100 purchase\xc2\xa0and was thinking of serving a hot cocktail \xe2\x80\x94 "just something to make it a little more cozy," she said.\n"I think it will draw in more family people in the neighborhood as opposed to just regular shoppers. I\xc2\xa0feel like people stay around this neighborhood for Thanksgiving," she said. "It\'s nice to just do a little something."\nGregg Bishop, the city\'s Department of Small Business Services commissioner,\xc2\xa0said the agency tries to prepare small businesses for the big shopping weekend \xe2\x80\x94 and the holiday season that follows \xe2\x80\x94 with workshops and marketing tips, as well as\xc2\xa0pushing out the message to shop small on social media and through radio advertisements. SBS is also participating in a lighting ceremony at the Empire State Building on Nov. 21 in celebration of Small Business Saturday.\nBishop\xc2\xa0said smaller shops can actually have a few advantages over the bigger ones.\n"You don\'t have the crowds, all the negative stuff that you see," he said. "You have the flexibility of knowing you can walk into a store\xc2\xa0and find something unique."\nStill, Karen Zebulon, who owns the Boerum Hill children\'s store\xc2\xa0Gumbo, said Black Friday and Small Business Saturday are not very busy for her. Instead, the last couple of weeks before Christmas are when business really picks up.\n"I always think of Black Friday as a big-box store, people are running to get the big technology items. They\'re not really going into the small stores as much on Friday," she said, adding she wishes Small Business Saturday was not the same weekend as Black Friday. "People have gone out, they\'ve spent huge amounts of money. I\xc2\xa0just feel like it overpowers Small Business Saturday. It\'s hard for people to even focus on it or recognize it."\nBy Alison Fox alison.fox@amny.com\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nComments\nWe\'re revamping our Comments section.

"It\'s a WiFi connection that you can download through an app on your phone, and that provides fully encrypted WiFi connectivity, and you\'re connected automatically any time you\'re within the range of a LinkPHL kiosk."\xc2\xa0The kiosks are paid for by advertising displayed on the 55-inch kiosk screens. They also have USB ports for phone charging and more.\xc2\xa0"We have an integrated tablet where you can make free phone calls anywhere in the United States," Hensley said. "You can access information, city services, social services, weather and transit information. There\'s also a maps feature. So people should just play around with the tablet. There\'s no login required and we don\'t take any personal information from using the tablets."\xc2\xa0We sure have come a long way from public payphones.\xc2\xa0"It\'s true. It is the payphone of the future, but way cooler," Hensley said. "And free.

It is, however, on the endangered list and hanging by a thin cord.About 99,800 public pay phones still operate in the U.S., down from 2.1 million in 1999, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates operations. New York has the most of any state, about one-fifth of the remaining pay phones, and North Dakota has the fewest, about 100.Colorado had 1,246 usable pay phones as of March 2016, the latest data available.\nNot many remain in Colorado Springs. Those prime locations in front of convenience stores now are occupied by Redbox movie-rental machines, and the phones have been removed from city and El Paso County buildings, including jails.\n'New' Westside Community Garden is looking for a few green thumbsDefunct pay phones with torn wires, missing receivers, graffiti or other vandalism can be found here and there, outside the Greyhound bus station downtown, in the parking lot of a Native Roots grass and gas station on Academy Boulevard and near a 7-Eleven in the Hillside neighborhood, for instance.But a few still work, including one at Uintah Gardens on West Uintah Avenue.A weathered phone book dangles beneath it. The cost to start a conversation: 50 cents. Prepaid phone cards and credit cards are accepted, and it has a local directory assistance feature.Do many people use it?\xe2\x80\x9cOff and on,\xe2\x80\x9d a clerk at a nearby gas station replies. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not very much.\xe2\x80\x9dLack of use prompted the pay phone to be turned off last year in the Teller County Courthouse lobby in Cripple Creek.Another sign of the technological times.\xe2\x80\x9cIn this day and age, everybody uses cellphones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lynn Fenn, administrative assistant.Many people don\xe2\x80\x99t even notice the pay phone near the metal detector in the historical 1904 courthouse.It\xe2\x80\x99s become as much of a fixture as the sign where jurors check in, which says: \xe2\x80\x9cNo claim jumping. Respect women, mules and the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n14 regional franchises Colorado Springs residents wish we had\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny, when we questioned people in the building, \xe2\x80\x98Do you ever see anybody use the pay phone?\xe2\x80\x99 many said, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a pay phone?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Fenn said. \xe2\x80\x9cA few people knew \xe2\x80\x94 those who\xe2\x80\x99ve worked here for many years.\xe2\x80\x9dAnyone who needs to make a call but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a cellphone can use an office phone in the lobby, she said.Mobile phones are a primary reason for the pay phone\xe2\x80\x99s demise, said Mark Thomas, who in 1995 started cataloging pay-phone locations as an art project. He was inspired, in part, by comedian David Letterman, who would call pay-phone numbers on his \xe2\x80\x9cLate Night\xe2\x80\x9d talk show to see if anyone would answer.Thomas, a concert pianist from Queens, N.Y., created a website, The Payphone Project, which lists pay phone numbers, locations and industry news.He traces the pay phone\xe2\x80\x99s fall from relevance to the Lifeline program, which gives free phones to the poor, a reliable pay-phone customer base.\xe2\x80\x9cLifeline seemed like it was created to target all that was left of the business,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas said.Nowadays, people seek out pay phones when they lose their cellphone, forget it at home or the battery runs out, he said.\xe2\x80\x9cI still encounter an occasional Luddite who will not carry a cellphone,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas said. And, \xe2\x80\x9cI still see a lot of travelers using calling cards to call home from pay phones.\xe2\x80\x9dMore interesting, he said, are the cases of people who use pay phones so their call cannot be traced.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was reported that in some cities, there had been increases in 911 calls made from pay phones because people calling to report crimes did not want to be associated with them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is intended to be impossible to hide your cellphone or landline number from 911, so some who call 911 don\xe2\x80\x99t want any chance of their number being involved in a criminal investigation. They look for a pay phone.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo help keep the industry viable, the FCC lifted audit requirements in February, saying they were \xe2\x80\x9cno longer justified as payphone revenues have plummeted due to a changing communications marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9dThe expensive audits became \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary to ensure that the few remaining providers are compensated fairly,\xe2\x80\x9d an FCC news release says.But pay-phone eulogies are premature, Thomas said.\xe2\x80\x9cThere will always be a need for communication access that is available to the lowest common denominator,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think all public pay phones should be free for local calls, and government subsidies could keep the dial tone alive in remote areas, national parks and poor neighborhoods. \xe2\x80\x9dMore evidence that pay phones have not outlived their usefulness: In October, officials from the U.S. Forest Service and Washington state\xe2\x80\x99s Snohomish County installed a new pay phone in Verlot, Wash., a scenic area where cellphone service is unreliable and the need for communication was seen as a public safety issue.Thomas has been tracking the \xe2\x80\x9cpay phone of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d called the LinkNYC kiosk, which he says have been \xe2\x80\x9cpopping up like mushrooms all over New York.\xe2\x80\x9dThe program converts old pay phones into Wi-Fi hotspots where free calls can be made to all 50 states and Washington, D.C.The 9\xc2\xbd-foot-tall \xe2\x80\x9cLinks\xe2\x80\x9d also provide Android tablet computers to access city maps, get directions and make video calls, plus two free USB-charging stations for smartphones, the ability to use calling cards to make international calls and a 911 button.Thomas said he tries not to wax nostalgic about how, back in the day, neighborhood pay phones were society\xe2\x80\x99s communications bedrock, and the phone booth provided privacy not only for telephone calls, but also for Clark Kent to transform into Superman.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not lost on me that there was something to be said for a time when pay-phone calls were important, and the pay-as-you-go motif made every minute and finish-line-second count,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9cI would miss the rugged but comfortable call quality of a working landline pay phone. Call quality is so far superior to those LinkNYC machines that there\xe2\x80\x99s no comparison.\xe2\x80\x9dContact the writer: 719-476-1656.\nContact the writer: 719-476-1656.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nTags\nColorado Springs\nLife\nPay Phones\nDebbie Kelley\nReporter\nStaff reporter, education and general news and features\nFollow Debbie Kelley\nClose\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\nYour notification has been saved.\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n{{description}}\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\nSave\nManage followed notifications\nClose\nFollowed notifications\nPlease log in to use this feature\nLog In\nDon't have an account?

The company expects to deploy 100 throughout the city.\n"I expect that Philadelphians and visitors to our great City will use and love all that LinkPHL has to offer. It is exciting to finally see the kiosks launch today in Center City,"\xc2\xa0Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement. "LinkPHL\xe2\x80\x99s many amenities support our SmartCityPHL goal of creating a modern infrastructure that will benefit Philadelphia for many years to come."\nHave you heard of #LinkPHL? The new kiosks provide free secure wifi, phone calls, wayfinding, device charging, access to City services, and community info \xe2\x80\x94 and they\'re completely free to use! Learn more about the program and how you can use the kiosks \xe2\x9e\xa1\xef\xb8\x8f https://t.co/WW1BWDaj1C pic.twitter.com/Qg3HD27PgU\n\xe2\x80\x94 City of Philadelphia (@PhiladelphiaGov) December 7, 2018\nDive Insight:\nSince rolling out in 2016, Link\xe2\x80\x99s kiosks have become a popular amenity\xc2\xa0in cities like New York and Newark, NJ.\xc2\xa0In an interview with Smart Cities Dive in September, Amanda Giddon, Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s senior consumer marketing manager, said more than 5 million people have connected to the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 Wi-Fi, showing that while they have helped provide information to residents, they are also helping more people get online.\nThe initiative has also generated millions of dollars in revenue for New York City through advertising, and has created new jobs.\xc2\xa0Some report that retail business near the kiosks has experienced an uptick.\nAnd Giddon said the evolution in content on Link kiosks is well underway, including what she called a "moment-based campaign,"\xc2\xa0which in New York City has included historical information about marches in the lead-up to the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March and voter registration drives before elections. She said to expect similar efforts in Philadelphia, including an expansion of its #ArtOnLink program, which showcases the work of local artists on the 55-inch displays. "It\'s been a fun exercise to think about how to localize this at scale,"\xc2\xa0Giddon said.\nThe company has its eye on cautious expansion to other U.S. cities, and with this move has expanded its footprint outside of the Greater New York region. (Intersection also has deployed Link kiosks in London through the InLinkUK initiative.)\xc2\xa0If all goes well, and the company\'s information on transit, weather, local services and news mixes well with more off-beat and whimsical content, it could continue to move outward, especially as cities look to use technology like this to close the digital divide.\nGiddon said the company plans to make the kiosks a "beloved member of the community it serves,"\xc2\xa0especially by monitoring its content and making sure it keeps up with people\xe2\x80\x99s needs. "We are definitely evolving every day from a content perspective, but we\'ve done pretty extensive user research to ask what people want to see,"\xc2\xa0she said. "We definitely have lessons learned and will look to add that local flair in our new Link markets."\nRecommended Reading:\nCity of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia Launches LinkPHL\nFollow\nChris Teale\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nBuildings & Infrastructure\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nIntersection\nGet the Newsletter\nSubscribe to Smart Cities Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nEmail:\nSmart Cities Dive\nTopics covered: energy, green building, transportation, waste solutions, connectivity, policy and more.\nDaily\nSign up\nA valid email address is required.\nPlease select at least one newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our privacy policy.

TP-Link is touting a total tri-band speed of nearly 11 Gbps for the larger of the two units (AX11000 \xe2\x80\x93 which is presumably the logic behind its name) and says that the new router will deliver \xe2\x80\x98great network performance for your gaming experience\xe2\x80\x99. Clearly the design is meant for the gaming room.Above: TP-Link\xe2\x80\x99s new Archer AX11000 Wi-Fi 6 gaming routerTP-Link does not inform us of the configuration but with eight fairly obvious antennas protruding from its case, we think 8\xc3\x978 (or 4\xc3\x974) MU-MIMO could be a good guess. Following the Netgear announcement last month, and D-Links launch early this year, TP-Link is only the third consumer-grade Wi-Fi vendor (that we know of) to launch a Wi-Fi 6 product. At least five enterprise Wi-Fi solution vendors have already launched Wi-Fi access point products. No device-side Wi-Fi 6 clients have thus far been launched but the first are expected during 1H2019.The Archer AX6000 unit will retail at $350 USD while the larger AX11000 will retail at $450 USD. Unfortunately, shipments will only start in January \xe2\x80\x93 so there won\xe2\x80\x99t be Wi-Fi 6-capable Archers under the Christmas trees this year.\xc2\xa0First five LinkNYC-style free Wi-Fi kiosk up and running in PhillyAbove: An InLinkUK kiosk installed in LondonThe first five of a planned one hundred LinkNYC-style free Wi-Fi electronic billboards is now up and running in the city of Philadelphia, USA. The project is aptly called LinkPHL (pronounced \xe2\x80\x98Link Philly\xe2\x80\x99) and this is the fourth project of its type following the original LinkNYC in New York City, LinkNWK (pronounced \xe2\x80\x98Linked Newark\xe2\x80\x99), and InLinkUK in the United Kingdom. In the US the three projects are operated by Intersection, while in the UK Intersection is partnering with BT for operations. For an impressive overview of the wide extent of the UK project, see a map of current InLinkUK locations, see this link.The schemes are funded by electronic billboard advertising. The city of Philadelphia and Intersection will evenly split advertising revenues guaranteeing the city a revenue of $450,000 per year, said the Philadelphia Enquirer earlier this year.\xc2\xa0LinkNYC currently serves 5 million users and some 20 million Wi-Fi sessions per week, says Intersection. Earlier this year, InLinkUK was shortlisted for the Wi-Fi NOW Affordable Connectivity award.Editors note: The above section on Link free Wi-Fi projects has been corrected 12.14.2018.Nokia inks first Wi-Fi mesh service provider dealNokia has been conspicuously late (and nearly absent) in addressing the burgeoning and lucrative home Wi-Fi mesh business opportunity. But a couple of weeks ago, the company finally managed to secure their first major home Wi-Fi win: The customer is AIS Fibre in Thailand, who as of February this year reported that it serves around half a million households with fibre-based broadband.According to the press release\xc2\xa0AIS Fibre customers in Thailand \xe2\x80\x9cwill be eligible to receive the Nokia WiFi Beacon 3 duo-pack for a special price.\xe2\x80\x9d Conceptually, the Nokia mesh solution \xe2\x80\x93 called \xe2\x80\x98Nokia Beacon\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 looks similar to many of its brethren although Nokia says the solution also detects and mitigates \xe2\x80\x98non-Wi-Fi\xe2\x80\x99 interference sources./Claus.\nWi-Fi Industry NewsJune 20, 2019 [Regulation & Policy]Europe\xe2\x80\x99s process to release 6 GHz spectrum to Wi-Fi on track, expert saysJune 18, 2019 [Breaking News]Emergency \xe2\x80\x98Ducklink\xe2\x80\x99 Wi-Fi to save lives during disastersJune 17, 2019 [Breaking News]Facebook takes on leadership role to improve Wi-FiJune 16, 2019 [News Exclusive]South Africa: Vast Networks\xe2\x80\x99 Wi-Fi offload trial with Vodacom \xe2\x80\x98faster than cellular\xe2\x80\x99June 13, 2019 [Breaking News]World\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Wi-Fi 6 trial tees off at US Open with Cisco & USGAJune 12, 2019 [Weekly News Brief]Wi-Fi news roundup: Aruba, Marvell, Quantenna, Newracom, and moreJune 12, 2019 [Breaking News]Greece to start building nationwide free public Wi-Fi networkMay 30, 2019 [Breaking News]Cuba to legalise private Wi-Fi networks by end JulyMay 30, 2019 [Breaking News]Wi-Fi 6 enters steep growth phase far outpacing 5G, says IDCMay 30, 2019 [CHIPSET NEWS]Wi-Fi HaLow IoT startup Morse Micro lands US$17M in Series A financingSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribe to Wi-Fi NOW Get the latest Wi-Fi industry news & information from Wi-Fi NOW every weekName*\nFirst\nLast CompanyEmail* Country*\nAfghanistan\xc3\x85land IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarrussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Democratic Republic of theCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaC\xc3\xb4te d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCura\xc3\xa7aoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\xc3\xa9unionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Barth\xc3\xa9lemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen IslandsSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe Country\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

To fill an obvious need of urban citizens \xe2\x80\x94 to stay connected and charged \xe2\x80\x94 the startup launched the Soofa Bench, a solar-powered phone charging bench equipped with a sensor to detect pedestrian activity.\nAs time has passed, Soofa\xe2\x80\x99s focus has remained on citizen engagement and forward-thinking innovation \xe2\x80\x94 though its product development has evolved the company into a competitive leader in smart infrastructure. In 2016, Soofa unveiled the Soofa Sign, a digital display that acts as a bulletin board for information on public transit, community events and local business offerings.\nThe Soofa Sign has become a staple for community engagement in Boston, Atlanta and Las Vegas, and the Miami-Dade region will soon welcome Soofa Signs as early as March 2019, thanks to support from Ford\xe2\x80\x99s City of Tomorrow Challenge.\nEdward Krafcik\nSoofa\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn true Soofa fashion, we built the software in a way that is fully democratized so that it\'s not only for cities to communicate with citizens but it really is for everybody to have a dialogue in neighborhoods ... \xc2\xa0And ultimately that\'s how it\'s financed \xe2\x80\x94 through the local business advertising dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Edward Krafcik, Soofa\xe2\x80\x99s Vice President of City Development.\nSmart Cities Dive caught up with Krafcik to learn more about Soofa\xe2\x80\x99s developments in Miami-Dade, its strategies for separating itself from digital kiosk competitors,\xc2\xa0and the pros and cons of ad-funded infrastructure.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nSMART CITIES DIVE: How does Soofa Sign differentiate from kiosks like Intersection\'s LinkNYC, and how do you compete with those companies?\nEDWARD KRAFCIK: I think fundamentally what makes us different is the fact that the platform is completely open and we\'re really leaning pretty strongly into this idea of the digital bulletin board. If you look at all the other kiosks, whether it\'s LinkNYC or there\'s a number of advertising companies that are creating a kiosk, at the end of the day it\'s about providing information to people.\xc2\xa0The way that we do it is that it\'s not just pushing information out,\xc2\xa0but it\'s really giving everyone an opportunity to respond and create their own information. So that idea of complete openness and democratization of communication is where we really fundamentally differ from a lot of the other kiosk companies.\nWe are fully solar-powered and wirelessly connected. The unit to install only takes four bolts on the ground \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s no need to excavate the sidewalk, there\'s no need to run power to it, it\'s completely sustainable and self-sufficient. So ultimately the unit cost is a fraction of the unit cost of something like a big kiosk, and perhaps more importantly, the time on the costs associated to install it is no more than 30 minutes.\nThe conversation shifted to equity, which was a topic highlighted in a recent TechCrunch article regarding ad-based infrastructure, referenced in this interview.\nWe\'ve been able to deploy these in very, very livable neighborhoods, very transformative and emerging neighborhoods ...\xc2\xa0Then you go just a few miles away and we\'re in [neighborhoods]\xc2\xa0where there\'s a lot in transition, there\'s a lot of energy but it\'s not a rich neighborhood. Not a place where maybe you would see some of these bigger kiosks being able to survive because the business model doesn\'t enable that kind of a system to actually operate in the type of a neighborhood where there\'s not crazy foot traffic and there\'s not big brands willing to spend money to be there.\nWhat we\'re doing is focusing on a deployment strategy that lets us go into all neighborhoods, whether they are very wealthy or they\'re emerging. So from the city\'s perspective, they now have a real communication platform that is equitably distributed ... We\'re not going to throw any competitor under the bus and say our technology is superior, but what is different is the ability to do this in the first place with a sustainable business model because we go into a neighborhood where you\'ll see people advertising on the sign that run a local business.\nInstallation of a Soofa Sign.\nSoofa\nHow is Soofa utilizing its prize money from the Ford City of Tomorrow Challenge?\nKRAFCIK:\xc2\xa0So that $50,000 will fund the part of the capital and operating costs through for the first year of the signs [in Miami-Dade]. So that helps us with a pretty heavy lift ... We\'re still a startup so it\'s a pretty sizable amount of capital to go and deploy new signs.\nFord is helping with that, and they\'re also a title sponsor ... The sign has not only the electronic paper displays on the digital side but it also has vinyl decals ... Ford, as a title sponsor, ultimately will have their logo on that back vinyl so it\'s up for a year throughout the pilot, everybody knows that Ford Motors and Ford Smart Mobility is powering this communication platform and that\'s a strategy actually that\'s starting to resonate. We\'ve done something similar in Las Vegas with T-Mobile.\nWe call these kind of larger companies "underwriting sponsors,"\xc2\xa0so it\'s not that dissimilar to a bike-share where someone would come in \xe2\x80\x94 like Citibank to sponsor Citi Bikes in New York \xe2\x80\x94 and they\'re essentially paying to have their name associated with a very beneficial public service. The only difference for us in the way that we really tell the story to a sponsor like a T-Mobile or a Ford is, instead of the bike-share where you help get people from Point A to Point B, really the goal for the sign is to help them more fully connect once they get to Point B from Point A. And I think for a brand, to be part of a conversation with the neighborhood in a city they care about in a way like this is so much more authentic than just putting a billboard up.\nCan you talk me through your data collection process?\xc2\xa0What type of data is Soofa collecting, how are you protecting it and who are you offering data to?\nKRAFCIK:\xc2\xa0I mentioned the bench had a sensor inside of it. So the sensor is the same sensor that we include in the sign. What this does is it measures pedestrian activity by listening for anyone with a Wi-Fi enabled device that walks by. What we get is a timestamp and an encrypted MAC address associated with the Wi-Fi enabled device.\nWe take that data and when we deliver it back to, let\'s say the City of Atlanta or the City of Las Vegas or the City of Boston, and what is returned is basically a very high-level aggregation of a time period,\xc2\xa0being a time of day split into hours with an estimated number of people that walks by. So what we then deliver is insights into the public realm usage and the public realm levels of activation, so it\'s quite high level. And it\'s all anonymized so we don\'t have any personal identifiable information.\nWhen you look at the privacy policy now on our website \xe2\x80\x94 which we\'ve always had, we\'ve just made it a little more prominent \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0we built this privacy policy almost two years ago when we worked with the Parks Department from New York City, who at that time wanted to buy a bench. ... It had a sensor which didn\'t seem like a big deal, but it was a very big deal for procurement in New York. They said there\'s no way the Parks Department would buy a bench with the sensor unless it goes through [the city\'s]\xc2\xa0privacy guidelines, which at that time were just a draft. So it was pretty amazing, we actually co-wrote the New York City IoT guidelines with the City of New York Mayor\'s Office of Tech and Innovation, because they needed a case study to use, which was the parks project.\nSo there\'s no personally identifiable information collected. The insights are largely around understanding just how public spaces \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0whether it\'s a plaza, it\'s a sidewalk on a street, it\'s a park \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0how they get used, not only the number of people per time period but also the repeat visitation rate. We can look at, over a period of time, how many people are coming back to this particular space and we can look at that as a percentage of total. Then we\'re also doing things like dwell time to see how long somebody actually stays in a particular location.\nSoofa\nWhat does \'smart city\' mean to you, or the company at large?\nKRAFCIK:\xc2\xa0Ever since we started the company, the reason we started with the bench was that it was something that was ubiquitous. It was the need that everybody had which to stay connected by staying charged. I think it is helpful for the public to see a technology and keep on thinking about this term "smart city" and see technologies that manifest that theme as a real product.\nFrom where I sit in particular,\xc2\xa0so much of my work is with city council members,\xc2\xa0with mayors, with real estate developers and public private partnerships, where at the end of the day there sort of needs to be this phrase that brings together a group of stakeholders. So in a lot of ways, the idea for us is that "smart city" is that phrase that helps connect a lot of very diverse groups and people to achieve a common theme, which is to improve the citizen experience using technology.\nFor us, "smart city" goes into being not just smart but really social \xe2\x80\x94 and using technology to improve citizen experience therefore means using technology to bring people together to do a lot of what was being done on the internet through social network. Replicating that, but in the real world.\xc2\xa0Not forgetting that people co-exist in neighborhoods. ... The smart city will use technology in a way that brings people outside of the apartment together in cool programs, cool events, cool neighborhood gatherings. At least how we define it, the smart city is really a sustainable and social city, with "social" being one of the key words.\nWhat are you most excited for moving forward?\nKRAFCIK:\xc2\xa0The phrase "ad-supported city infrastructure" I think is very, very scary ... In some cases, the infrastructure that\'s being deployed is costly in a way that really can only be recovered and be sustainably funded through large advertising dollars. And there\'s really no other way around it.\nAdvertising has become a little bit scary because, what you don\'t want to have happen as an elected official is put in a kiosk that is supported by advertising \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0and maybe you have the citizens\' best interests in mind, and the kiosks will provide Wi-Fi, the kiosks will provide city services and announcements and dynamic digital wayfinding \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0but the problem now is, as we\'re seeing more of these being deployed, a lot of the advertising that needs to be shown to fund those amenities is irrelevant. It\'s part of a broader DMA strategy for a brand.\nAnd then you have all the citizens saying, "I don\'t really care this much about these services that are being offered because I don\'t want to see the advertisements. I\'d rather do without the services entirely because the advertising is not relevant to me."\n"The idea for us is that \'smart city\' is that phrase that helps connect a lot of very diverse groups and people to achieve a common theme, which is to improve the citizen experience using technology."\nEdward Krafcik\nVP City Development, Soofa\nI think what I\'m most excited for and, as a company, what we\'re super excited to see is that there is a path forward where an advertisement-supported amenity like a Soofa Sign or particular community bulletin board can be funded sustainably ... In a way where the city can can get a revenue share, and that money can be reinvested into the public realm.\nThis is all possible. I think we\'re seeing a change happen. ... We can work with with larger companies to transform how they\'re messaging so that it\'s relevant to the local audience that it\'s being shown to, so that content is paired with relevant community content that\'s user generated,\xc2\xa0that\'s generated by local businesses, that\'s generated by neighborhood associations in the city.\nSo what you end up with is an advertising-funded asset and amenity that feels a little bit more like Instagram where you see companies really being more creative [and]\xc2\xa0thoughtful because they want to feel like they\'re natively part of someone\'s feed. That\'s what we\'re starting to see with the advertising-supported model that we have in neighborhoods.\nFollow\nKristin Musulin\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nSoofa\nGet smart cities news like this in your inbox daily.

I\'m contacting you through a burner email address, because I don\'t think I want to identify myself as the culprit. You might understand my indecision better if you knew who I am. Or maybe not. I don\'t know."\nThe email was unsigned, delivered only under the moniker "stupid city." It contained a 2,000 word manifesto outlining the motives and methods for the writer\'s ongoing manipulation of the ubiquitous kiosks. It was neither a prank nor a hack, he clarified, but something he deemed street theater \xe2\x80\x94 "an ephemeral kind of performance art that subverts a repugnant piece of street furniture (LinkNYC)."\nI quickly responded to the email to ask for proof of his handiwork, and he suggested we meet in person for a live rendition. After a period of contemplation, "stupid city" agreed to let us share his identity, so long his face wasn\'t visible in any photos. Likewise, I only briefly considered the possibility that I was living out a Stephen King horror novel, soon to find myself locked in the freezer of an ice cream truck, my final cries blotted out by the somnolent jingle.\nFrom the moment the nine-a-half-foot tall screens began springing up on city sidewalks in early 2016, promising free gigabit speed Wi-Fi and domestic calls, Mark Thomas said he saw their alternative application as a broadcast platform. In the years since, he\'s conceived dozens of soundscapes, including his own experimental noise pieces, spoken word poetry and spooky piano compositions. He observed MLK Day by playing the "I have a dream" speech along Broadway in Astoria, and once held a curbside memorial honoring the passing of radio legend Joe Frank through four machines at once.\nBut it wasn\'t until earlier this year that Thomas hit on sonic gold, with his eerily slowed-down take on the familiar Mister Softee theme song. "It sounded irritating and bad," he explained. "I decided to stick with it." As time went on, he added air horns and numbers sequences that offered clues to his identity.\nThroughout the summer, befuddled pedestrians shared videos of the howling tablets online, some testifying to having witnessed the creepy tune blaring "seemingly in unison" from up to ten hotspots at once. A few people speculated that it was the result of hackers, possibly the Russians, or else yet another intrusive guerilla marketing campaign. A spokesperson for LinkNYC tried to downplay the development, insisting that it was merely "an old fashioned phone prank."\nMaybe so. But the strange missive that had landed in my inbox touched on something else behind the haunting broadcasts. "I have what I guess you\'d call a set of grievances about the kiosks, and how the company behind them has failed to do anything particularly innovative with the unearned municipal privilege they enjoy with their monopoly franchise," Thomas wrote.\n"I have never understood the fundamental premise of LinkNYC, that every single outdoor payphone should be routed and replaced with this unproven alternative, or how such a broad decision affecting the public interest was reached without a single call for public input." (Representatives for LinkNYC disputes this characterization of the community feedback process).\nLong before he began tormenting the auditory cortices of unsuspecting New Yorkers, Thomas loved payphones. A self-described "phone phreak," his obsession began in high school, when he\'d spend hours in his bedroom dialing a booth on a seedy Tampa Bay street, then playing piano for whatever stranger picked up. As an adult, in the 1990s and early 2000s, he maintained the largest database of payphone numbers and addresses in the world, which he made public on his website in the hopes that others would pick up his teenage hobby.\nWhen the New York Times profiled Thomas in 2004, they found that his Payphone Project had grown into a practical tool for desperate people across the world\xe2\x80\x94a parent searching for her runaway daughter, detectives seeking a predator, etc.\xe2\x80\x94while staying true to its goal of forging "whimsical acts of contact" between strangers. \'\'Pay phones are lifelines for the down and out; their booths are rainy-day cocoons,\'\' he\'d told the newspaper. \'\'You lose those, and you lose a lot of windows onto the human condition.\'\'\nSo it makes an obvious sense that Mayor Bill de Blasio\'s decision to rip out most of the city\'s 7,500 payphones and replace them with decidedly less-cocoonish digital obelisks would inspire a very specific grudge in Thomas. The fact that LinkNYC is effectively underwritten by Google, through its subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which was founded by former deputy mayor and "smart city"-booster Dan Doctoroff, likely did not cushion the blow for the self-identified artist.\nBut when we finally meet in midtown on a Tuesday afternoon, the 50-year-old Thomas does not appear overly preoccupied with nostalgia or vengeance. He\'s far more interested in demonstrating his process, which involves using the kiosk\'s free domestic calling feature to dial one of the countless conference call numbers he\'s rigged with various pieces. He then cranks up the volume on the device, clicks back to the home screen, and walks away.\nEach of his recordings begins with sixty seconds of silence, a detail he added after discovering that people in certain areas, particularly Murray Hill and the Upper East Side, "really hated when the serenity of their neighborhoods were disrupted by noise blasting out of these things." This "magic minute," as he\'s dubbed it, helps Thomas to avoid detection, while also allowing him to program several machines at once.\nOur chosen intersection, 42nd Street and Third Avenue, places us within a one-block radius of eight different machines. I watch as he punches a number into the keypad, then blends into the stream of office workers and emerges at another machine fifty yards away. The spontaneous jingle draws a few gaping expressions and exaggerated double-takes. Mostly, New Yorkers react to the song by stealing only a momentary glance at their surroundings, seeming to acknowledge and then accept the oddity without breaking stride. The reaction is a bit better over the summer, Thomas points out, because sound carries further in heat.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true. All along third ave they are playing the Mr. Softee song. Was this truly not intentional? Wow. It feels like a psychological experiment. pic.twitter.com/LBJKHaWWBD\xe2\x80\x94 Steve Burges (@stevenatschool) May 23, 2018\nThroughout the demonstration, Thomas, a trained classical pianist and former web developer, seems quietly pleased by his symphony. Ears tuned forward like antennae, he observes how his favorites pieces "tangle in with the rest of the street noise and fill those little washes of silence that come in when traffic has moved on." While there are advantages to the built-in audience of Midtown, he\'s partial to lonelier kiosks in Sunset Park, and one in particular located under the 7 train in Corona.\nIf there is an apparent contradiction in the project\xe2\x80\x94his beaming pride in the pieces and simultaneous gripes with the devices themselves\xe2\x80\x94Thomas is not worried about it. He\'s not particularly focused on fears raised by watchdog groups about illicit data-mining and surveillance overreach either. His core beef with LinkNYC is rooted in the singular fact that they claim to be "the payphone of the future," when their primary purpose seems to be serving up digital advertisements to non-consenting pedestrians.\n"I consider the kiosks themselves to be unwanted, unasked for irritants, and to express that sentiment I turned the kiosks themselves into irritants," Thomas explains. But he\'s also quick to emphasize that he considers his work not as a protest but as a sort of one-man outsider art project, and that he views LinkNYC as "less of a threat than an opportunity." He\'d be happy for others to take up the mantle of street theater as well.\nIs there a deeper meaning behind his taunting Mister Softee remix? A dissonant clapback at the techno-utopian delusions of the smart city, perhaps? A winking reference to one of the extant targets of Mayor Bloomberg\'s city-sanitizing campaign?\nNo, not really. He was just messing around on his laptop one day and inadvertently played the jingle at half speed, he says.\nEventually, I ask Thomas whether LinkNYC is aware of his efforts. He believes that they are, and that the company may have even gone through the trouble of rewiring the network because of him. While users were once able to place uninterrupted calls for four hours at a time, the kiosks now require you to confirm that you\'re still there after 10 (or sometimes three) minutes. It wouldn\'t be particularly hard for them to find him, he notes, waving to one of the tablet\'s three cameras.\nLinkNYC would not comment directly on Thomas\'s work, though a spokesperson for the NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications told Gothamist: "Considering that more than five million people have used LinkNYC because it\xe2\x80\x99s fast, free, safe, and useful, it makes sense that among them there\xe2\x80\x99s a prankster."\nFor now, Thomas plans to continue staging his unique brand of street theater, spreading false hope to ice cream lovers, and pumping countless other works of noise through the towering monoliths across the city. He has many reasons for doing this, but chief among them is that it brings him joy.\n"For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to feel invisible yet present, and this is as close as I think I\'ve come to reaching that goal," he wrote in that mysterious introduction. "I feel like a ghost, but at the same time I am hiding in plain sight."\n#linknyc\n#mister softee\n#mystery solved\n#phone phreak\n#phone phreaking\nDo you know the scoop? \xc2\xa0 Comment below or Send us a Tip\nFeatured in Arts & Entertainment\nRead More In:\nNews\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nPopular\nDashed Arrow\nBack to Top\nGothamist\nSend Us a Story Idea\nFollow Us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nGothamist is a website about New York City news, arts and events, and food, brought to you by New York Public Radio.\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nParty Confetti\nDashed Arrow\nSign up for our newsletter!
