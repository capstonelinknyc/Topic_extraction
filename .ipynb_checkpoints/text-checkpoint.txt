S'Photos: Someone Smashed The Hell Out Of Dozens Of LinkNYC Kiosks : Gothamist\nSupport Us\nNYPR Network\nNYPR Network\nGothamist is a website about New York\nView Pretty | Blog\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nNews\nPopular\nWe The Commuters\nAdvertising\nContact\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nPhotos: Someone Smashed The Hell Out Of Dozens Of LinkNYC Kiosks\nby Jake Offenhartz in News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Apr 22, 2019 1:52 pm\nfullscreen\ncontinue\nview fullscreen\nclose\nThe war between man and machine is heating up, and this time it has nothing to do with Mister Softee.\nIn the last few days, an unidentified vandal and/or Blade Runner has smashed at least 30 LinkNYC kiosks in the West Village and Chelsea, leaving a trail of destruction along 6th and 8th Avenues and across 14th Street. Several of the screens remained black as of Monday morning, while a few others continued to display their standard programming\xe2\x80\x94ads for North Face, #LinkNYCfacts, ads for CitiBank, etc.\xe2\x80\x94through concentric circles of shattered glass.\nObserves Gothamist Editor-In-Chief John Del Signore: "This is why we can\'t have nice dystopian capitalist data harvesting things."\nyikes, somebody went around the village smashing all of the @LinkNYC screens pic.twitter.com/swdtWL82TI\xe2\x80\x94 Josh Machiz (@Machiz) April 20, 2019\nAfter several New Yorkers took note of the rampage online, a spokesperson for LinkNYC said the company was aware of the damage and looking into it. "LinkNYC provides a valuable public service to many of the city\'s most vulnerable," they wrote on Twitter. "When people vandalize Links, they impede on its ability to fund and deliver these services."\nBut not everyone sees it that way. Mark Thomas\xe2\x80\x94a Queens resident who for years has been protesting the company by transforming the structures into ad-hoc noise machines\xe2\x80\x94told Gothamist that it felt like LinkNYC was "using the poor as pawns [to say] \'please don\'t smash our ads.\'"\n"They didn\'t get into the business to serve the poor and vulnerable," he added. "They did it to sell ads and make lots of money."\nHave not seen a @LinkNYC vandalized this blatantly before. Both sides, on 14th between 7th & 8th pic.twitter.com/QOy5L1q187\xe2\x80\x94 Dave Temkin (@dtemkin) April 22, 2019\nSince launching in 2016, the hulking tablets\xe2\x80\x94which now number roughly 1,700 citywide\xe2\x80\x94have faced scrutiny from privacy experts and civil liberties groups over their business model\'s potential for surveillance overreach. The kiosks are effectively underwritten by Google through a subsidiary called Sidewalk Labs, which is headed by former deputy mayor and Hudson Yards-booster Dan Doctoroff. Privately, Doctoroff has described the company\'s plans to track pedestrians and serve them targeted ads, with the goal of "replicating the digital experience in physical space."\nIn addition to offering free gigabit-speed wi-fi and domestic calling, each kiosk includes thirty sensors and three security cameras. According to LinkNYC, footage from the cameras may be shared with law enforcement "to protect your safety, including during an emergency involving potential harm," and in instances of vandalism.\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for the company told Gothamist that the vandal had been spotted on one of the security cameras, and that the footage was shown to the NYPD. The police department did not have any information about LinkNYC-bashing related arrests.\nAccording to Thomas, the prolific spree does seem "a bit scary," considering it likely means a very determined and possibly angry individual is walking around the city with a sledgehammer (or whatever tool of destruction was used).\nAt the same time, he noted, "I did see some beautiful things in the carnage. Somebody\'s really got something to say, and this is their way of saying it."

The charging, phone, Wi-Fi and other functions of the kiosks appear to be unaffected.\nLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter account talked about how the kiosks help the homeless and those with low income writing:\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC provides a valuable public service to many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable. When people vandalize Links, they impede on its ability to fund and deliver these services.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, the telecom companies that operate the roughly 1,700 kiosks are not exactly hurting for cash. The ads are expected to generate about a billion dollars over 12 years; the city gets half that money.\nThe NYPD may also soon be arresting the screen cracking culprit. He was caught on the security cameras of one of the kiosks.\nSubmit tips to police by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477), visiting http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com, or texting 274637 (CRIMES) then entering TIP577.

A rock was used to smash the kiosk.\nSeveral of the screens remained black as of Monday morning, while a few others continued to display their standard programming.\nSecurity footage captured the person causing the damage and several good Samaritans called police to provide a suspect description.\nNo arrests have been made, but a witness described the vandal as a white male who was last seen wearing a black shirt, jeans and was carrying an "I Love NY" bag.\nLinkNYC provides a way to access the internet, a public service that for some is their only way to get internet service. A company spokesperson released the following statement:\n"LinkNYC provides a valuable public service to many of the city\'s most vulnerable. The most dialed number using the tablet phone app is the EBT customer service line; and in a recent survey of LinkNYC users, 15% of respondents from New York said it is their only high speed internet connection. That number goes up to 29% in some areas of the city. When people vandalize Links, they impede on its ability to fund and deliver these services."\nHave not seen a @LinkNYC vandalized this blatantly before.

The usual addictions \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0a quick email check, as if the elevator ride since the last one had been more than 30 seconds. Then Google Maps to see when the next train was coming, as if I could do anything but get on. Given my neck-bent focus I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice the woman at the LinkNYC kiosk until I was a few feet in front of her. She was hunched over even more than I was, talking into the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s screen.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling you from the kiosk,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman was saying,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I lost my iPhone.\xe2\x80\x9d The man on the other end sounded confused. You could hear his voice because the woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t have headphones, so her call wasn\xe2\x80\x99t private.\nShe was wearing just a white T-shirt even though it was cold and drizzling. She was carrying some belongings in plastic bags. She sounded distressed but not acutely distressed, more like losing a cell phone was one more in a line of things to be distressed about.\nMaybe I got that impression because of the other people standing on the corner near the kiosk. Someone charging their phone, two guys doing the lean-stagger that tends to mean you\xe2\x80\x99re high on something. An infamous midtown McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is a block away, where people go to buy Klonopin or sleep through their Methadone.\nMaybe I got that impression due to assumptions about the people who often use the shiny kiosks, which were basically meant to replace\xc2\xa0payphones. Now the kiosk advertisement screens tell us to buy cars or perfume or go vote. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the little tablet embedded\xc2\xa0on the side that was the subject of horror and glee a couple years ago when homeless people (or a homeless person or two) figured out how to watch pornography out there on the streets.\nIntersection, the company provider for the kiosks, has moved beyond the porn problem but added other tools for people who might not have a phone or laptop or an unlimited data plan\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0a problem in stark contrast to the phone addiction of all those zombies you see walking with their heads on emails or Instagram.\nThe company says it sees 9,000 tablet searches per month on the social service directory Aunt Bertha.\nSign up for amExpress, the conversation starter for New Yorkers.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nOf the 600,000 monthly calls facilitated by the kiosks, Intersection says the state EBT line is the most dialed, where callers can get questions answered about food stamps and similar services.\nMaybe the woman in the white T-shirt who\xe2\x80\x99d lost her phone was someone who might use\xc2\xa0the kiosks for urgent reasons. Maybe a phone meant something more to her than an addictive device. Maybe she had a story to tell. This occurred to me just after I swiped into the subway station for my ride home and saw that the train whose arrival I\xe2\x80\x99d been checking had just left. My eyes had been on the phone almost the whole time. I put my phone and its screen back in my pocket and reality returned.\nI went back through the turnstile and jogged up the stairs into the drizzle, rounded the corner past the lean-stagger men to the kiosk to see whether\xc2\xa0the woman would talk to me.\nBut by the time I got there, she was gone.\nBy Mark Chiusano mark.chiusano@amny.com\n@mjchiusano\nMark Chiusano has been a columnist and editorial writer for amNewYork and Newsday since 2015.\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nComments\nWe're revamping our Comments section.

So went the thinking back in 2014, when then-mayor Michael Bloomberg launched a competition \xe2\x80\x94 the Reinvent Payphones initiative \xe2\x80\x94 calling on private enterprises, residents, and nonprofits to submit designs for spruced-up, publicly accessible hubs that would provide advertising-subsidized services to the public.\nCityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC beat out piezoelectric pressure plates, EV charging stations, and other competing proposals for a contract, and the consortium wasted no time in getting to work. Intersection \xe2\x80\x94 which with Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes manages the kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 said it plans to spend $200 million laying down 400 miles of new communication cables and installing as many as 10,000 Links that supply free Wi-Fi to passersby within a 150-foot radius. The first kiosk went online in January, though the project has quite a ways to go \xe2\x80\x94 1,780 Links are active currently, short of the initial goal of 4,500 kiosks by July of this year. But many promised features \xe2\x80\x94 like buttons that link directly to 911 and New York\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service, USB chargers, backup batteries, and a VoIP service that allows free calls to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. \xe2\x80\x94 made their way into the final design.\nAnd the initial kiosks have really taken off. According to Intersection, the LinkNYC network now has more than 6 million unique users who have used 8.597 terabytes of data collectively \xe2\x80\x94 equivalent to about 1.3 billion songs or 292 billion WhatsApp messages. And the project facilitates 600,000 phone calls every month, up from 500,000 in September of last year.\nPeople using the Links\xe2\x80\x99 tethered tablets complete about 9,000 searches per month on the built-in social services directory and 311 app, Intersection says, with the most common search terms being: \xe2\x80\x9cwork,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chousing health,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d Almost 3 times the numbers of searches \xe2\x80\x94 36,000 per month \xe2\x80\x94 are performed in the Maps app, the bulk of which are for \xe2\x80\x9cmidnight run,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfood/clothing delivery,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBest Buy,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmovie theaters.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe mishmash of metrics underscores the fact that for some New Yorkers, the Link hubs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a convenience \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re a lifeline.\nA 2015 study by the New York City Bureau of Policy and Research found that 25 percent of NYC residents don\xe2\x80\x99t have home broadband internet, including 32 percent of unemployed residents. And according to a 2015 survey published by the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Consumer Affairs, 44.5 percent of residents without an income didn\xe2\x80\x99t own a cell phone or a service plan. It\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps unsurprising, then, that the most-dialed number on Link hubs is the New York State Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) helpline, through which families can access Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and other social support.\nFour years ago, Mayor Bill De Blasio touted the Links as a sign of progress in the fight for a democratized internet. \xe2\x80\x9c[They\xe2\x80\x99re] the fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[and] a critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt bears mentioning that LinkNYC isn\xe2\x80\x99t a philanthropic effort \xe2\x80\x94 investors extended $150 million in financing to Intersection in 2017. Moreover, despite the fact that revenue fell short of expectations in the first two years \xe2\x80\x94 the city collected $43.4 million in payments, narrowly beating the $42.5 million minimum CityBridge guaranteed \xe2\x80\x94 display ads, sponsorships, and partnerships on the Links are expected to generate between $500 million and a billion dollars over the next 12 years. (CityBridge and the city split the ad revenue equally; under an amended deal, CityBridge will delay paying the city its share of revenues above the minimum payments until the last year of the contract, when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be due with 10 percent interest.)\nThat said, Intersection contends it\xe2\x80\x99s doing its part to promote art, culture, and political participation through its army of kiosks. When the Links\xe2\x80\x99 screens aren\xe2\x80\x99t showing real-time bus arrivals and local maps, programming consists of rotating regular, seasonal, and limited-time content collaborations with organizations, publications, and government agencies. That includes headlines from the Associated Press, comics, weather info, and real-time alerts from the Office of Emergency Management, along with hundreds of hyperlocal factoids \xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis Day in New York\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about people, places, and things.\nTo date, Intersection says it has showed 40 local artists, 2,000 local events, and 750 NYC Facts \xe2\x80\x94 oh, and seven marriage proposals.\nOn the civic engagement side of the equation, Intersection last April teamed up with the New York City Council to roll out Participatory Budgeting New York City, which let residents as young as 11 vote via the tablets on how the city will allocate a $1-million-per-neighborhood public budget. (This weekend marks the launch of its second year.) Intersection also launched an awareness campaign to get New Yorkers registered to vote in advance of the November 2018 general elections, and it circulates Community Board meeting notices and local road closures through its LinkLocal program, which lets small businesses advertise for free on select Links around the city.\nIntersection says there were 14,473 tablet app sessions to access voter registration and voter information this past election cycle and that over 150 board meeting notices are on LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s regular content rotation.\nEncouraging as those stats might be, they\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to assuage Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s loudest critics, some of whom \xe2\x80\x94 including the Intercept, the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Stop LinkNYC, and ReThink LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x94 have brought attention to the hubs\xe2\x80\x99 potential for mass surveillance. Each Link is equipped with three cameras capable of, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor[ing] pedestrian, bike, and car traffic; track[ing] passing wireless devices; listen[ing] to street noise; and \xe2\x80\xa6 identify[ing] abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIntersection says it makes clear in its privacy policy that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. In response to allegations that it intends to track Wi-Fi users\xe2\x80\x99 real-time positions, Intersection says it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collect their clickstream data or browsing history. It also says that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share data with third parties freely and makes \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attempts\xe2\x80\x9d to notify affected users in the event it receives a data-pull request from a government agency.\nIntersection added vision-assistance tools after the National Federation of the Blind sued the City of New York and LinkNYC, arguing that the tablets lacked basic accessibility features. (They\xe2\x80\x99re now are fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.) And some advocacy groups have levied nuisance complaints against Intersection, claiming that the Links encourage loitering. The tablets initially had an internet browser, but engineers disabled it in response to complaints about users browsing pornographic material.\nFor better or worse, those bumps in the road haven\xe2\x80\x99t dissuaded expansion. Beginning in 2017, in collaboration with British telecommunications company BT and British advertising agency Primesight, Intersection began installing hundreds of hubs in the U.K., including in London, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, where they\xe2\x80\x99re branded LinkUK. Elsewhere, kiosks have been installed in the New Jersey city of Newark (LinkNWK), across the Hudson River from Manhattan, and on the busiest street corners in Philadelphia (LinkPHL).\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be a combination of lessons learned and ensuring we add a little local flavor [to our programing],\xe2\x80\x9d Amanda Giddon, senior consumer marketing manager at Intersection, told VentureBeat in an earlier interview. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have research teams in New York and Philadelphia who\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted some preliminary focus group testing to understand how to best serve the community. We\xe2\x80\x99re really open to feedback, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work here and look forward to seeing how it\xe2\x80\x99s received.\xe2\x80\x9d"

Over 1,600 of these towering, nine-and-a-half-foot monoliths \xe2\x80\x94 their double-sided screens\xc2\xa0festooned with ads and fun facts \xe2\x80\x94 have been installed across the city since early 2016. Mayor Bill de Blasio has celebrated their ability to provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d Anyone can use the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 Android tablets to search for directions and services; they are also equipped with charging stations, 911 buttons, and phones for free domestic calls.\nBut even as the kiosks have provided important services to connect New Yorkers, they\xc2\xa0may\xc2\xa0also\xc2\xa0represent\xc2\xa0a troubling expansion of the city\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance network,\xc2\xa0potentially connecting every borough to a new level of invasive monitoring. Each kiosk has three cameras,\xc2\xa030 sensors, and heightened sight lines for viewing above crowds.\nSince plans for LinkNYC were first unveiled, journalists, residents, and civil liberties experts have raised concerns that\xc2\xa0the internet kiosks might be storing sensitive data about its users and possibly tracking their movements. For the last two years, the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a small but vocal group of activists \xe2\x80\x94 including ReThink LinkNYC, a grassroots anti-surveillance group, and the anonymous Stop LinkNYC coalition \xe2\x80\x94 have highlighted the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s potential to track locations, collect personal information, and fuel mass surveillance.\nNow an undergraduate researcher has discovered indications in LinkNYC code\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 accidentally made public on the internet\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0that LinkNYC may be actively planning to track users\xe2\x80\x99 locations.\nMayor Bill de Blasio speaks at\xc2\xa0a press conference next to\xc2\xa0a LinkNYC public internet\xc2\xa0kiosk on Feb 18, 2016.\nPhoto: Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the Product\nPlans to replace the city\xe2\x80\x99s payphone booth network with Wi-Fi-enabled kiosks were first announced by de Blasio in 2014. Less than a year later, the city awarded a contract to a chameleon-like consortium of private companies known as CityBridge. It was an attractive deal: LinkNYC kiosks, at no cost to the city, would provide free internet coverage to anyone walking by. CityBridge, in turn, would be responsible for the installation, ownership, and construction of the devices, with plans to earn back its expenses through advertising. The twin 55-inch displays will eventually carry targeted ads derived from the information collected about kiosk users.\nThese terms raised alarms among internet researchers and privacy experts, who were quick to point out that nothing in life is truly free. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we know,\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin Dean, a technology policy analyst, told attendees at a New York hacking conference in 2016, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the customer \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re the product.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe key player in CityBridge is known as Intersection, and one of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s largest investors is Sidewalk Labs, with whom it also shares the same offices and staff. Sidewalk Labs CEO Daniel Doctoroff is the chair of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s board. Sidewalk Labs is owned by Google\xe2\x80\x99s holding company, Alphabet Inc. In other words, the\xc2\xa0plan to blanket New York City with 7,500 camera-equipped obelisks has been largely underwritten by the company formerly known as Google \xe2\x80\x94 a corporation whose business model depends on selling your personal information to advertisers. As Doctoroff, who was also the city\xe2\x80\x99s former deputy mayor of economic development, has said of the kiosks: \xe2\x80\x9cBy having access to the browsing activity of people using the Wi-Fi \xe2\x80\x94 all anonymized and aggregated \xe2\x80\x94 we can actually then target ads to people in proximity and then obviously over time, track them through lots of different things, like beacons and location services, as well as their browsing activity. So in effect, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is replicating the digital experience in physical space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union raised multiple concerns with the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s vast and indefinite data retention and the possibilities for unwarranted NYPD surveillance. The NYCLU asked whether environmental sensors and cameras would be hooked up to NYPD systems, including the Domain Awareness System (built by Microsoft). LinkNYC has since updated its policy to state that it will take reasonable efforts to notify users if their information is being shared with law enforcement.\nIn May of this year, Charles Meyers, an undergraduate at New York City College of Technology, came across folders in LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s public library on GitHub, a platform for managing files and software, that appear to raise further questions about location tracking and the platform\xe2\x80\x99s protection of its users\xe2\x80\x99 data. Meyers made copies of the codebases in question \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC Mobile Observation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and shared both folders with The Intercept.\nAccording to Meyers, the \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC Mobile Observation\xe2\x80\x9d code collects the user\xe2\x80\x99s longitude and latitude, as well as the user\xe2\x80\x99s browser type, operating system, device type, device identifiers, and full URL clickstreams (including date and time) and aggregates this information into a database. In Meyers\xe2\x80\x99s view, this code \xe2\x80\x94 along with the functions of the \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d codebase \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that the company is interested in tracking the locations of Wi-Fi users in real time.\xc2\xa0If such code were run on a mobile app or kiosk, he said, the company would be able\xc2\xa0to make advertisements available in real time based on where and who someone was, and that this would constitute a potential violation of the company\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy.\xc2\xa0In 2016, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy made it clear that it did not collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d it states, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know where we provide WiFi services, so when you use the services we can determine your general location.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC disputes these speculations. David Mitchell, Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s chief technology officer, told the Intercept that the code was never intended to be released and was part of a longer-term research and development process. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this instance,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained over email, \xe2\x80\x9cIntersection was prototyping and testing some ideas internally, using employee data only, and mistakenly made source code public on Github. This code is not in use on the LinkNYC network.\xe2\x80\x9d An Intersection spokesperson added that LinkNYC does not collect users\xe2\x80\x99 clickstream data or browsing history, and that it has not used the \xe2\x80\x9cRxLocation\xe2\x80\x9d codebase to collect user data. LinkNYC did not respond to repeated questions about the function or purpose of the code.\nThe Intercept asked four technologists, including a computer forensics investigator and an expert on Wi-Fi location tracking, to independently review the code. Each confirmed that the code could execute commands as Meyers had described, but they emphasized that it was not possible to determine the purpose of the code and whether it was actually running on any kiosks or devices\xc2\xa0based on the information given. They concluded that it was unlikely that\xc2\xa0the code\xc2\xa0was currently in use, as its unfinished security features pointed to the fact that\xc2\xa0it appeared to be in progress, possibly for a mobile product. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it exists, but the fact that it exists is creepy,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Surya Mattu, a research scientist and artist. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way properly to interrogate this further as a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor many researchers and privacy experts, this lack of third party oversight represents the\xc2\xa0most significant issue. Privacy experts told The Intercept that the lack of clarity surrounding LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s leaked code points to the larger lack of transparency surrounding the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s operations. Despite their omnipresence in the city\xe2\x80\x99s major public spaces, LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s pervasive data collection is not constrained by any auditing mechanisms, explained Daniel Schwarz, a technology fellow at the NYCLU. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout transparency and external auditing of the source code, as well as what data is collected, for what purpose, and how it is being monetized by the company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no way to verify whether the privacy policy is working to protect users\xe2\x80\x99 data.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA few hours after The Intercept contacted LinkNYC for comment, the company demanded that Github remove Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s copy of its code due to copyright violations.\nPedestrians pass one of the new Wi-Fi kiosks that offer free web surfing, phone calls and a charging station on August 24, 2016 in New York City.\nPhoto: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\nConnecting \xe2\x80\x94 and Controlling \xe2\x80\x94 Communities\nAs LinkNYC expands across the globe \xe2\x80\x94 Intersection has unveiled plans for kiosks in Philadelphia, Toronto, and the U.K. \xe2\x80\x94 so too does the scope of the concerns surrounding it. Shahid Buttar, the EFF\xe2\x80\x99s director of grassroots advocacy, has warned of the possibility of mission creep \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the expansion of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s uses beyond its stated purpose to provide free Wi-Fi. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to presume that a current statement of policy will constrain the consortium of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Buttar said.\nLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s current privacy policy already shows that the company sweeps up enormous amounts of sensitive data\xc2\xa0from all users, such as \xe2\x80\x9cMAC address (anonymized), IP address, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, device type, and device identifiers.\xe2\x80\x9d LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy classifies this information as technical, rather than personal, data.\xc2\xa0It may occasionally \xe2\x80\x9csupplement anonymized Technical Information we collect from you with information collected by third parties. Third parties may include advertising partners or other providers that help us understand our users.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis distinction, privacy experts say, ignores the fact that device identifiers \xe2\x80\x94 even when anonymized \xe2\x80\x94 provide more than enough information to tell advertisers, law enforcement, or malefactors who we are, since most phones and computers are used by the individuals who own them. Knowing\xc2\xa0that a device has been in multiple locations, along with\xc2\xa0the history of the Wi-Fi networks it has visited,\xc2\xa0can provide enough information for someone to find out where individuals live, work, commute, shop, and so on.\xc2\xa0A recent Associated Press investigation found that many Google services for Android devices and iPhones were storing location data even if when users had turned on a privacy setting to prevent Google from doing so.\nAccording to privacy watchdogs, the rollout of the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s cameras have shown how the mission has already expanded beyond its initial purview. In 2016, LinkNYC disclosed that the kiosks \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d contain cameras; by 2017, the cameras were operational. LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy states that cameras do not keep video records for more than seven days and that the camera footage is used to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove the services.\xe2\x80\x9d But opting out is not an option: Just by walking down the block, it is possible to be swept into its audio or video feeds, which can capture a nearly 360-degree view of their surroundings. Civil liberties experts have concerns about the circumstances under which CityBridge will share its ongoing taping with law enforcement. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, according to documents obtained by ReCode, Sidewalk Labs is selling kiosks to other cities that will be able to \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor pedestrian, bike and car traffic, track passing wireless devices, listen to street noise and use the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 built-in video cameras to identify abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s chief innovation officer told MIT Tech Review that it was considering upgrading kiosks to support augmented reality and autonomous vehicles.\nJoin Our NewsletterOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.I\xe2\x80\x99m in\nThe NYCLU and EFF stated that the ambiguity surrounding Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the code underscores the need for community-driven initiatives to protect the privacy and civil liberties of users. As EFF has noted, there are no means for New Yorkers to participate in decisions about how data from LinkNYC kiosks will be used, with whom they will be shared, for how long they will be retained, or whether the parameters under which they\xc2\xa0are initially collected might expand in the future. In response to Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s findings, ReThink LinkNYC is calling for third-party oversight to confirm that the company\xe2\x80\x99s software does what it says it does.\nThe New York City Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the calls for auditing and stronger oversight. Samir Saini, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT),\xc2\xa0wrote in an email to The Intercept following the publication of the story that \xe2\x80\x9cas a public project, LinkNYC can only exist if it conforms to the City\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous commitment to user privacy. That means the City does not, and will never, allow the network operator \xe2\x80\x94 CityBridge \xe2\x80\x94 to exploit individual identifiers or precise location of LinkNYC users. If, at any time during our careful oversight of CityBridge, we discover practices that violate the Privacy Policy, we will direct CityBridge to immediately cease and desist from that practice. It is unfortunate that CityBridge inadvertently posted code on Github for an R&D project they were working on. CityBridge is not permitted to use code that tracks the precise location of users on the LinkNYC network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a follow-up email to The Intercept, Saini explained that city\xe2\x80\x99s audits will be \xe2\x80\x9ctriggered when DoITT feels that an investigation of specific franchisee practices is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0At present there are no regular audits of the CityBridge agreement to determine whether LinkNYC is violating users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s being held to its standards because there is so much opacity and not enough transparency surrounding the system,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Buttar. \xe2\x80\x9cThere needs to be some designated processes with public accountability and participation before the kiosk system and private organizations that constitute the consortium can propose changes unilaterally on millions of users.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCorrection: September 18, 2018\nThis article has been updated with comments from Samir Saini, commissioner\xc2\xa0of the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, who contacted The Intercept after publication. Saini clarified the LinkNYC privacy policy and explained that CityBridge does not retain the right to collect information about the specific websites users visit on their own devices.\nUpdate: September 10, 2018\nCharles Meyers filed a counter notice with Github, challenging LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s takedown demand, and he has made the code he found available again here.\nWe depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

Images will be displayed from the Museum\xe2\x80\x99s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs.\nPasserby on the street will be able to catch a glimpse of the old New York through the lens of the iconic film director. Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s photographs highlight his formative years as a photographer (before he became a film director) for Look magazine in New York City between 1945-1950. The photographs focus on and capture the pathos of everyday life of the city, from street scenes to sporting events.\nThe LinkNYC kiosks can be found dotted all over the city. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the program in 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs and have replaced the old pay phones with sleek kiosks that feature free Wi-Fi, phone chargers, and digital displays for advertisements and in this case, art.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that LinkNYC has featured art on its kiosks from MCNY. Previous \xe2\x80\x9cexhibitions\xe2\x80\x9d on the kiosks include historic photos of women who influenced New York\xe2\x80\x99s political history for Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month and \xe2\x80\x9cOn This Day in NYC History\xe2\x80\x9d information. The MCNY and LinkNYC partnership is one of many programs that disseminate New York City\xe2\x80\x99s history; others include the NYC Space/Time Directory from the New York Public Library, an app from Urban Archive that made more than 2,500 images of old New York available on-the-go, and a Civil Rights & Social Justice Map from the Greenwich Village Society.\nLinkNYC\nMCNY\nPublic Art\nRelated Stories\nApril 17, 2019\nWhere There's a Willis\nHank Willis Thomas creates 25-foot-tall Afro pick for 5th Avenue\nApril 11, 2019\nTwo Become One\nTwo major art and design fabricators merge into new powerhouse\nApril 10, 2019\nUntitled, 1989\nFelix Gonzalez-Torres\xe2\x80\x99s black billboard returns for WorldPride NYC\nApril 4, 2019\nA Triumph of Foil\nChristo to wrap the Arc de Triomphe in plastic next spring\nTrending\nMost Popular\nMost Recent\nFoster + Partners pitches new Notre Dame spire as competition heats up\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what saved the Notre Dame Cathedral from total destruction\nThe Cursed Architecture Twitter feed showcases the best of the worst\nFrance launches an international competition to rebuild Notre Dame\xe2\x80\x99s spire\nAlbright-Knox Art Gallery reveals new expansion renderings\nFoster + Partners pitches new Notre Dame spire as competition heats up\nOCEANIX and BIG unveil a floating city of the future at the United Nations\nPhotographs document the Italian Fascist architecture of Eritrea\nA leaning Manhattan tower draws blame from both sides\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what saved the Notre Dame Cathedral from total destruction\nIs Windsor, Florida, peak New Urbanism?\nChicago\xe2\x80\x99s Graham Foundation spotlights Arakawa and Madeline Gins\nDe Blasio cracks down on glass towers as part of Green New Deal\nPepsi denies plans to advertise in space\nLA-M\xc3\xa1s designs colorful accessory dwelling units for Los Angeles\nCopyright 2019The Architect's Newspaper, LLCAll rights reserved.\nRegions\nInternational\nEast\nSoutheast\nMidwest\nWest\nSouthwest\nTopics\nAN Interior\nArchitecture\nArt\nDesign\nDevelopment\nPreservation\nTransportation\nUrbanism\nNewsletters\nFacades+\nSpec Sheet\nCity Terrain\nLate Edition: East\nLate Edition: West\nLate Edition: Midwest\nLate Edition: Southwest\nConferences\nFacades+ Conference\nFacades+ AM\nTech+\nInformation\nAwards\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nMap\nThe Architect's Newspaper, LLC | 21 Murray Street, 5th Floor | New York, NY 10007 | tel. 212.966.0630\nCopyright 2019, All rights reserved."

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls\xc2\xa0or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What are the main features the kiosks offer?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How do they improve the lives of residents?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0What type of ads do the kiosks display?Fasoldt:\xc2\xa0LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do the kiosks use any analytics?Fasoltd:\xc2\xa0We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Digital Signage Today:\xc2\xa0Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?Fastold:\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model.

aS'Creepy Mister Softee Mystery Solved: Meet The Man Who Uses LinkNYC To Freak Out NYers: Gothamist\nSupport Us\nNYPR Network\nNYPR Network\nGothamist is a website about New York\nView Pretty | Blog\nArts & Entertainment\nFood\nNews\nPopular\nWe The Commuters\nAdvertising\nContact\nNewsletter\nRSS Feed\nStaff\nCreepy Mister Softee Mystery Solved: Meet The Man Who Uses LinkNYC To Freak Out NYers\nby Jake Offenhartz in Arts & Entertainment\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Dec 13, 2018 1:25 pm\n(Jennifer Hsu / Gothamist)\nOn the day before Halloween, nearly six months after we were first puzzled by the slo-mo Mister Softee jingle invading the sidewalk Wi-Fi tablets of New York City, I received a cryptic email that began as follows: "I\'m the one who\'s been making the LinkNYC kiosks blast Mister Softee, and other noises and sounds. I\'m contacting you through a burner email address, because I don\'t think I want to identify myself as the culprit. You might understand my indecision better if you knew who I am. Or maybe not. I don\'t know."\nThe email was unsigned, delivered only under the moniker "stupid city." It contained a 2,000 word manifesto outlining the motives and methods for the writer\'s ongoing manipulation of the ubiquitous kiosks. It was neither a prank nor a hack, he clarified, but something he deemed street theater \xe2\x80\x94 "an ephemeral kind of performance art that subverts a repugnant piece of street furniture (LinkNYC)."\nI quickly responded to the email to ask for proof of his handiwork, and he suggested we meet in person for a live rendition. After a period of contemplation, "stupid city" agreed to let us share his identity, so long his face wasn\'t visible in any photos. Likewise, I only briefly considered the possibility that I was living out a Stephen King horror novel, soon to find myself locked in the freezer of an ice cream truck, my final cries blotted out by the somnolent jingle.\nFrom the moment the nine-a-half-foot tall screens began springing up on city sidewalks in early 2016, promising free gigabit speed Wi-Fi and domestic calls, Mark Thomas said he saw their alternative application as a broadcast platform. In the years since, he\'s conceived dozens of soundscapes, including his own experimental noise pieces, spoken word poetry and spooky piano compositions. He observed MLK Day by playing the "I have a dream" speech along Broadway in Astoria, and once held a curbside memorial honoring the passing of radio legend Joe Frank through four machines at once.\nBut it wasn\'t until earlier this year that Thomas hit on sonic gold, with his eerily slowed-down take on the familiar Mister Softee theme song. "It sounded irritating and bad," he explained. "I decided to stick with it." As time went on, he added air horns and numbers sequences that offered clues to his identity.\nThroughout the summer, befuddled pedestrians shared videos of the howling tablets online, some testifying to having witnessed the creepy tune blaring "seemingly in unison" from up to ten hotspots at once. A few people speculated that it was the result of hackers, possibly the Russians, or else yet another intrusive guerilla marketing campaign. A spokesperson for LinkNYC tried to downplay the development, insisting that it was merely "an old fashioned phone prank."\nMaybe so. But the strange missive that had landed in my inbox touched on something else behind the haunting broadcasts. "I have what I guess you\'d call a set of grievances about the kiosks, and how the company behind them has failed to do anything particularly innovative with the unearned municipal privilege they enjoy with their monopoly franchise," Thomas wrote.\n"I have never understood the fundamental premise of LinkNYC, that every single outdoor payphone should be routed and replaced with this unproven alternative, or how such a broad decision affecting the public interest was reached without a single call for public input." (Representatives for LinkNYC disputes this characterization of the community feedback process).\nLong before he began tormenting the auditory cortices of unsuspecting New Yorkers, Thomas loved payphones. A self-described "phone phreak," his obsession began in high school, when he\'d spend hours in his bedroom dialing a booth on a seedy Tampa Bay street, then playing piano for whatever stranger picked up. As an adult, in the 1990s and early 2000s, he maintained the largest database of payphone numbers and addresses in the world, which he made public on his website in the hopes that others would pick up his teenage hobby.\nWhen the New York Times profiled Thomas in 2004, they found that his Payphone Project had grown into a practical tool for desperate people across the world\xe2\x80\x94a parent searching for her runaway daughter, detectives seeking a predator, etc.\xe2\x80\x94while staying true to its goal of forging "whimsical acts of contact" between strangers. \'\'Pay phones are lifelines for the down and out; their booths are rainy-day cocoons,\'\' he\'d told the newspaper. \'\'You lose those, and you lose a lot of windows onto the human condition.\'\'\nSo it makes an obvious sense that Mayor Bill de Blasio\'s decision to rip out most of the city\'s 7,500 payphones and replace them with decidedly less-cocoonish digital obelisks would inspire a very specific grudge in Thomas. The fact that LinkNYC is effectively underwritten by Google, through its subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which was founded by former deputy mayor and "smart city"-booster Dan Doctoroff, likely did not cushion the blow for the self-identified artist.\nBut when we finally meet in midtown on a Tuesday afternoon, the 50-year-old Thomas does not appear overly preoccupied with nostalgia or vengeance. He\'s far more interested in demonstrating his process, which involves using the kiosk\'s free domestic calling feature to dial one of the countless conference call numbers he\'s rigged with various pieces. He then cranks up the volume on the device, clicks back to the home screen, and walks away.\nEach of his recordings begins with sixty seconds of silence, a detail he added after discovering that people in certain areas, particularly Murray Hill and the Upper East Side, "really hated when the serenity of their neighborhoods were disrupted by noise blasting out of these things." This "magic minute," as he\'s dubbed it, helps Thomas to avoid detection, while also allowing him to program several machines at once.\nOur chosen intersection, 42nd Street and Third Avenue, places us within a one-block radius of eight different machines. I watch as he punches a number into the keypad, then blends into the stream of office workers and emerges at another machine fifty yards away. The spontaneous jingle draws a few gaping expressions and exaggerated double-takes. Mostly, New Yorkers react to the song by stealing only a momentary glance at their surroundings, seeming to acknowledge and then accept the oddity without breaking stride. The reaction is a bit better over the summer, Thomas points out, because sound carries further in heat.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true. All along third ave they are playing the Mr. Softee song. Was this truly not intentional? Wow. It feels like a psychological experiment. pic.twitter.com/LBJKHaWWBD\xe2\x80\x94 Steve Burges (@stevenatschool) May 23, 2018\nThroughout the demonstration, Thomas, a trained classical pianist and former web developer, seems quietly pleased by his symphony. Ears tuned forward like antennae, he observes how his favorites pieces "tangle in with the rest of the street noise and fill those little washes of silence that come in when traffic has moved on." While there are advantages to the built-in audience of Midtown, he\'s partial to lonelier kiosks in Sunset Park, and one in particular located under the 7 train in Corona.\nIf there is an apparent contradiction in the project\xe2\x80\x94his beaming pride in the pieces and simultaneous gripes with the devices themselves\xe2\x80\x94Thomas is not worried about it. He\'s not particularly focused on fears raised by watchdog groups about illicit data-mining and surveillance overreach either. His core beef with LinkNYC is rooted in the singular fact that they claim to be "the payphone of the future," when their primary purpose seems to be serving up digital advertisements to non-consenting pedestrians.\n"I consider the kiosks themselves to be unwanted, unasked for irritants, and to express that sentiment I turned the kiosks themselves into irritants," Thomas explains. But he\'s also quick to emphasize that he considers his work not as a protest but as a sort of one-man outsider art project, and that he views LinkNYC as "less of a threat than an opportunity." He\'d be happy for others to take up the mantle of street theater as well.\nIs there a deeper meaning behind his taunting Mister Softee remix? A dissonant clapback at the techno-utopian delusions of the smart city, perhaps? A winking reference to one of the extant targets of Mayor Bloomberg\'s city-sanitizing campaign?\nNo, not really. He was just messing around on his laptop one day and inadvertently played the jingle at half speed, he says.\nEventually, I ask Thomas whether LinkNYC is aware of his efforts. He believes that they are, and that the company may have even gone through the trouble of rewiring the network because of him. While users were once able to place uninterrupted calls for four hours at a time, the kiosks now require you to confirm that you\'re still there after 10 (or sometimes three) minutes. It wouldn\'t be particularly hard for them to find him, he notes, waving to one of the tablet\'s three cameras.\nLinkNYC would not comment directly on Thomas\'s work, though a spokesperson for the NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications told Gothamist: "Considering that more than five million people have used LinkNYC because it\xe2\x80\x99s fast, free, safe, and useful, it makes sense that among them there\xe2\x80\x99s a prankster."\nFor now, Thomas plans to continue staging his unique brand of street theater, spreading false hope to ice cream lovers, and pumping countless other works of noise through the towering monoliths across the city. He has many reasons for doing this, but chief among them is that it brings him joy.\n"For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to feel invisible yet present, and this is as close as I think I\'ve come to reaching that goal," he wrote in that mysterious introduction. "I feel like a ghost, but at the same time I am hiding in plain sight."\nGothamist is now part of WNYC, a nonprofit organization that relies on its members for support.

The plan was to spend $200 million installing as many as 10,000 kiosks, or Links, that would supply free, encrypted gigabit Wi-Fi to passers-by within 150 feet. They would have buttons that link directly to 911 and New York\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service and free USB charging stations for smartphones, plus wired handsets that would allow free calls to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. And perhaps best of all, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the city a dime; advertising would subsidize expansion and ongoing maintenance.\nThe\xc2\xa0Links wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just get urbanites\xc2\xa0online and let them juice their phones, though. The idea was to engage users, too, principally with twin 55-inch high-definition displays and tethered Android tablets with map functions. Mike Gamaroff, head of innovation at Kinetic, characterized the Links in 2016 as \xe2\x80\x9cfirst and foremost a utility for the people of the city, that also doubles up as an advertising network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTwo years after the deployment of prototypical kiosks in Manhattan, Intersection \xe2\x80\x94 a part of the aforementioned CityBridge, which with Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes manages the kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 is ready to declare them a success. The roughly 1,600 Links recently hit three milestones: 1 billion sessions, 5 million users, and 500,000 phone calls a month.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an opportunity to communicate with people as they navigate their day,\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection senior consumer marketing manager Amanda Giddon told VentureBeat in a phone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mandate is to help make Link a part of the community through content and content strategy \xe2\x80\x94 really, anything that [makes] New Yorkers feel like tourists in their own city [or] even help tourists feel like New Yorkers through useful, actionable information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCreative content\nAt any given time, the Link kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 screens host news headlines from the Associated Press, comics, weather info, real-time alerts from the Office of Emergency Management, and creative from a mix of roughly 50 other campaigns. Also on tap are hundreds of hyperlocal factoids\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis Day in New York\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about people (\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Hildebrandt opened the United States\xe2\x80\x99 first tattoo business in New York City in 1870\xe2\x80\x9d), places (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a superhero supply store in Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x9d), and things (\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City gets 15 times more snow than the South Pole each year\xe2\x80\x9d). There are close to 400 trivia tidbits in all, with new ones joining the collection each week.\nGibbon researches the facts herself, typically spending a few hours a week\xc2\xa0poring through a range of sources, including Broadway.org, Grow NYC, Time Magazine, FiveThirtyEight, and the\xc2\xa0National History Museum. She dutifully fact-checks them and copies them to a master spreadsheet before deciding which ones will make the cut.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been really great to see people writing in about the content they see.\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve created some moments of awe for people, and if I can create a moment of awe for someone on a daily basis, then I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my job right,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Giddon said.\nWhen the kiosks aren\xe2\x80\x99t alerting pedestrians to, say, the percentage of New Yorkers riding elevators at any time, they display real-time bus arrivals and local maps. But the bulk of their programming consists of rotating regular, seasonal, and limited-time content collaborations with organizations, publications, and government agencies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe survey our users quite frequently [for ideas] \xe2\x80\xa6 and we go to great lengths to make sure our [content] is contextually relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giddon. \xe2\x80\x9c[We\xe2\x80\x99re] pioneering this publishing approach and public space and are really eager to get feedback and adjust as we continue to expand.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne recent example is a partnership with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) that showcased the work of local artists. Another is \xe2\x80\x9cPopular Places Near You,\xe2\x80\x9d a Foursquare-powered feature that shows top restaurants and entertainment hubs within walking distance.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the tip of the iceberg. Intersection worked with the Museum of the City of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Beyond Suffrage exhibit to feature NYC women in politics, with the NYC Department of Records to curate historical photography (localized at a neighborhood level), and with Silicon Harlem and Global Kids to showcase legendary\xc2\xa0African Americans\xc2\xa0during Black History Month.\nSocial services\nIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0also leveraging the kiosks to promote civic engagement.\nIn April, it teamed up with the New York City Council to roll out Participatory Budgeting New York City, which let residents as young as 11 vote via the kiosk tablets on how the city will allocate its $40 million public budget. And it launched an awareness campaign to get New Yorkers registered to vote in advance of the November 2018 general elections. (The latter integrated with the city\xe2\x80\x99s voter registration data to show a real-time count of the number of people signed up.) It also posts Community Board meeting notices and local road closures and through its LinkLocal program lets small businesses advertise for free on select kiosks around the city.\nIntersection has experimented with social services, too. In January, users were able to browse and enroll in health plans through New York State of Health insurance marketplace.\nFor some New Yorkers, the Link hubs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a convenience \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re a lifeline. A 2014 study by the Office of the New York City Comptroller found that 27 percent of NYC residents surveyed \xe2\x80\x94 40 percent of whom had less than a high school education \xe2\x80\x94 lacked broadband internet at home.\nWithout a reliable internet connection, students can\xe2\x80\x99t access online classroom resources, out-of-work adults can\xe2\x80\x99t submit job applications, and families struggling to make ends meet can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of social services. As the New York Times wrote in August 2016:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn urban areas, rural areas, and everywhere in between, students who lack internet service at home have difficulty doing their nightly schoolwork. Many of them cobble together whatever connectivity they can, picking up free Wi-Fi signals in front of libraries, in school parking lots, and at fast-food restaurants.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFour years ago, De Blasio\xc2\xa0touted the Links as a sign of progress in the fight for unimpeded internet access. \xe2\x80\x9c[They\xe2\x80\x99re] the fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[and] a critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d\nControversy\nBut the accolades tend to ignore the fact that LinkNYC isn\xe2\x80\x99t strictly a philanthropic effort. Advertisements that run alongside Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s programming were expected to generate between $500 million and a billion dollars over the next 12 years. (CityBridge and the city split the ad revenue equally.)\nAnd the kiosks themselves aren\xe2\x80\x99t without controversy.\nThe connected tablets initially had an internet browser, but Intersection disabled it in response to complaints about users browsing pornographic material. It also added vision-assistance tools after the National Federation of the Blind sued the City of New York and LinkNYC, arguing that the tablets lacked basic accessibility features.\nRevenue, meanwhile, has missed expectations.\xc2\xa0Over the first two years, the city collected $43.4 million in payments, narrowly beating the $42.5 million minimum CityBridge guaranteed. Under an amended deal, CityBridge will delay paying the city its share of revenues (above the minimum payments) until the last year of the contract, when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be due with 10 percent interest.\nAnd as The Intercept recently pointed out, consumer advocacy groups and activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Stop LinkNYC, and ReThink LinkNYC, have brought attention to the hubs\xe2\x80\x99 potential for mass surveillance.\nEach hub is equipped with three cameras and sensors capable of, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor[ing] pedestrian, bike, and car traffic; track[ing] passing wireless devices; listen[ing] to street noise; and \xe2\x80\xa6 identify[ing] abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNone of this has scared away investors, who extended $150 million in financing to Intersection last year.\nIntersection makes clear in its privacy policy that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. And in response to recent allegations that it intends to track Wi-Fi users\xe2\x80\x99 real-time positions, it said it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0collect their clickstream data or browsing history.\nAs Intersection and CityBridge eye expansion to new markets, Giddon said, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take into account feedback they\xe2\x80\x99ve received so far.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be a combination of lessons learned and ensuring we add a little local flavor [to our programing],\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe have research teams in New York and Philadelphia who\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted some preliminary focus group testing to understand how to best serve the community. We\xe2\x80\x99re really open to feedback, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work here and look forward to seeing how it\xe2\x80\x99s received.\nIntersection hopes to install 7,500 Link kiosks by 2026, when its contract with the city expires. In June, it launched InLinkUK, a partnership with telecom provider BT and outdoor advertising agency Primesight to replace over 1,000 pay phones in major U.K. cities with kiosks. In September, 100 kiosks\xc2\xa0hit the sidewalks of Philadelphia as part of its LinkPHL program. And by the end of this year, 45 will come to Newark."

A new campaign called Summer in the City to launch June 21st will feature images from the Museum\'s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs, which highlights the iconic film director\'s formative years in New York City as a photographer for Look magazine between 1945-1950.\n"We\'re proud to partner with MCNY to serve both residents and visitors by extending the Museum\'s rich archive of photography to the streets of New York," said Samir Saini, Commissioner for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. "New Yorkers in all five boroughs will catch a glimpse of history, art and culture just by passing by a LinkNYC kiosk. What better way to start the summer!"\n"In addition to providing super-fast, free Wi-Fi to four million New Yorkers and visitors, LinkNYC is fundamentally changing the way information is delivered on the go. Through the content on our digital displays, we have brought useful and enriching information to the streets of New York, including in partnership with great local organizations that have made Link a beloved member of the community," said Jen Hensley, President of Link. "We are so thrilled to partner with the Museum of the City of New York, a great New York City institution, to bring their incredible content to our five-borough network."\n"Partnering with LinkNYC and DoITT is the perfect opportunity to both extend our content beyond the walls of the Museum as well as reinforce the Museum\'s mission as an institution that captures the inclusive urban experience by spotlighting relevant contemporary issues important to New Yorkers," said Whitney Donhauser, Ronay Menschel Director of the Museum of the City of New York. "The Summer in the City campaign, featuring the photography of Stanley Kubrick encompasses the rich, diverse history of the city while giving you a glimpse into the iconic director\'s future work as an artist who continues to be celebrated globally."\nLinkNYC has partnered with the Museum on multiple campaigns, ranging from highlighting historic photos of women who influenced New York political history for Women\'s History Month from the Museum\'s exhibition, Beyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics, to surfacing new \'On This Day In NYC History\' (#OTDNYC) information every day. The programs aim to increase access to city history and delight New Yorkers and visitors while on the go.\nThrough a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs is made possible in part by Ann G. Tenenbaum and Thomas H. Lee, Nancy and Mitchell Steir, The Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation, The Andrew and Marina Lewin Foundation, Daryl Brown Uber/William E. Weiss Foundation, and George A. Kellner.\nThis exhibition is organized by the Museum of the City of New York in collaboration with SK Film Archives LLC.\nDigitization of the Stanley Kubrick Photographs from the Look magazine collection was made possible in part by the Charina Endowment Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Daryl Brown Uber/William E. Weiss Foundation, and other generous donors.\nDoITT is the technology core of New York City government, working with over 100 city agencies and entities to deliver the tech they need to serve and empower New Yorkers. DoITT\'s technology solutions help keep the five boroughs safe, strong, and vibrant. For more information, visit nyc.gov/DoITT or visit us on Facebook or Twitter.\nLinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next few years.\nMore than 4 million people - more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas, or San Diego - have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of new users joining the network each week.\nIn addition to free Wi-Fi, each Link offers free phone calls, device charging, and a tablet to access maps, 311, the social services platform Aunt Bertha, and access to 911. All of Link\'s services are 100% free for users and come at no cost to taxpayers.\nFor more information and to find a Link near you, visit link.nyc.\nFounded in 1923 as a private, nonprofit corporation, the Museum of the City of New York celebrates and interprets the city, educating the public about its distinctive character, especially its heritage of diversity, opportunity, and perpetual transformation. The Museum connects the past, present, and future of New York City, and serves the people of the city as well as visitors from around the world through exhibitions, school and public programs, publications, and collections.

aS"Pranksters Are Making LinkNYC Booths Play Ice Cream Van Music - Motherboard\ngotcha|by Joseph Cox|Jul 3 2018, 3:05pmPranksters Are Making LinkNYC Booths Play Ice Cream Van MusicLinkNYC's Wi-Fi and communication booths are taunting New Yorkers during a heatwave thanks to a clever prankster.SHARETWEETby Joseph Cox|Jul 3 2018, 3:05pmImage: ShutterstockSHARETWEETNew York City is insanely hot right now, which makes a recent prank even more cruel, or ingenious, depending on your perspective. Someone is going around New York, fiddling with the city\xe2\x80\x99s public LinkNYC internet booths, and making them blare out ice cream van music according to social media posts and LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone hacked the internet kiosk in front of my apartment and it\xe2\x80\x99s been playing the ice cream truck song for hours,\xe2\x80\x9d Chelsea Hassler, vice president and editorial director at communications agency Zeno Group, tweeted on Monday. LinkNYC confirmed the incident to Motherboard, but noted that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hack in a technical sense.Instead, LinkNYC told Motherboard in an email, people are using a booth\xe2\x80\x99s phone app to call a number\xe2\x80\x94where the person on the other end presumably plays their ice cream van music of choice\xe2\x80\x94and then pressing the home button on the booth to hide the call in progress.Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.LinkNYC has installed over a thousand of its booths across New York, which offer free Wi-Fi and other communication services. Critics have pointed to these devices\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99s potential for snooping because they include, with cameras and Bbluetooth beacons. Notably, LinkNYC added that it has deployed a feature that disables a call after 10 minutes if callers don\xe2\x80\x99t confirm they are present and using the booth. So, if the booths have been blasting out the music for hours as reported, perhaps someone is walking up and down New York making sure the devices don\xe2\x80\x99t hang up. Hassler added in another tweet that several booths were affected. LinkNYC told Motherboard that free access to its services does not mean that everyone is going to use the booths responsibly.SHARETWEETTagged:Ice CreamNew YorkHackingheatwavePrankstersphreakingLinkNYCWhere we're going, we don't need email.Sign up for Motherboard Premium.subscribeReadWatchTopicsMoveableHackingEnvironmentSpaceGamingHealthTechScienceInfluenceVICE ElsewhereVICE AppsVICE on TVVICE MagazineEditionenUnited StatesptBrasilfrFrancedeGermanyitItalynlNetherlandsesSpainenUnited StatesAboutTerms of UseContent Funding on VICEPrivacy Policy\xc2\xa9 2019 VICE Media LLC"

This and other concerns were raised during a 2015 discussion on Slashdot. While many people are comfortable in trading their privacy for ostensibly free services, it is disheartening when municipalities collaborate with business to make it happen. "In May of this year, Charles Meyers, an undergraduate at New York City College of Technology, came across folders in LinkNYC\'s public library on GitHub, a platform for managing files and software, that appear to raise further questions about location tracking and the platform\'s protection of its users\' data," reports The Intercept. "Meyers made copies of the codebases in question -- \'LinkNYC Mobile Observation\' and \'RxLocation\' -- and shared both folders with The Intercept."\nMeyers says the "LinkNYC Mobile Observation" code collects the user\'s longitude and latitude, browser type, OS, device type, device identifiers, and full URL clickstreams (including data and time) and "aggregates this information into a database," the report says. Meyer\'s believes the company is interested in tracking the location of Wi-Fi users in real time. "If such code were run on a mobile app or kiosk, he said, the company would be able to make advertisements available in real time based on where and who someone was, and that this would constitute a potential violation of the company\'s privacy policy," reports The Intercept.\nFollowing the revelations, LinkNYC said the code was never intended to be released and was part of a longer-term R&D process. "In this instance, David Mitchell, Intersection\'s CTO, told the Intercept in an email. "Intersection was prototyping and testing some ideas internally, using employee data only, and mistakenly made source code public on Github. This code is not in use on the LinkNYC network." [Intersection is the "key player" in CityBridge, "a chameleon-like consortium of private companies" that New York City contracted to turn the city\'s payphone booth network into Wi-Fi-enabled kiosks.]\nbusiness\ndata\nprivacy\n\xe2\x86\x90\nRelated Links\n\xe2\x86\x92\nMIT Machine Vision System Figures Out What It\'s Looking At By Itself\nSubmission: Free municipal WiFi may be the next front in the war against privacyNew York\'s Free LinkNYC Internet Kiosks Are Now Used By 5 Million Users, Who Have Participated in 1 Billion Sessions and Make 500,000 Phone Calls a MonthLinkNYC\'s 6 Million Users Have Used 8.6 Terabytes of Data\nCryptocurrency Wipeout Deepens To $640 Billion As Ether Leads Declines\nThis discussion has been archived.\nNo new comments can be posted.\nFree Municipal Wi-Fi May Be the Next Front In the War Against Privacy\nMore\nLogin\nFree Municipal Wi-Fi May Be the Next Front In the War Against Privacy\nArchived Discussion\nLoad All Comments\nFull\nAbbreviated\nHidden\n/Sea\nScore:\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\nMore\nLogin\nNickname:\nPassword:\nPublic Terminal\nForgot your password?\nClose\nClose\nSearch 76 Comments\nLog In/Create an Account\nComments Filter:\nAll\nInsightful\nInformative\nInteresting\nFunny\nThe Fine Print: The following comments are owned by whoever posted them.\nWe are not responsible for them in any way.\nby who\n(Score:2, Interesting)\nby Anonymous Coward writes:\nthe question has never been if your privacy is invaded. the question is only who do you prefer to invade your privacy\nRe:\n(Score:3)\nby commodore64_love ( 1445365 ) writes:\nI\'d prefer a private entity like Google or Apple, than a government entity that has police & soldiers & jails to make your life miserable.\n2 replies beneath your current threshold.\nMAC Spoofing?\n(Score:2)\nby sycodon ( 149926 ) writes:\nIs there no way to jack with the MAC address when connecting to WiFi?It may be embedded in the hardware somehow, but it has to go through software to connect to the wifi.THAT is a hack I\'d pay money for...a new MAC address every time a phone connects to WiFi\nRe: MAC Spoofing?\n(Score:3)\nby LordWabbit2 ( 2440804 ) writes:\nThere is an app for that, or supposedly you can do it manually, but I get access denied when I try, so despite what the article says you probably need a rooted phone.\nhttps://www.techpluto.com/how-...

The ironic twist is that most of us stand one one side or the other on at least one of these issues, feeling extremely righteous and virtuous about it, having no compunction even wishing for, or calling for the death of, opposing sides.\nMost will probably hail the new overlords that will put an end to this emerging chaos by application of autocratic force.

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls, or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Q. What are the main features the kiosks offer?A. LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Q. How do they improve the lives of residents?A. LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Q. How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?A. Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Q. What type of ads do the kiosks display?A. LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Q. Do the kiosks use any analytics?A. We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Q. Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?A.\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model. In addition to New York, a Link network is live in the U.K.\xc2\xa0We have planned expansions into Philadelphia and Newark, with many more cities on the way.Image via Link.Topics: Advertising, Audience Measurement, Content, Customer Experience, Display Technology, DOOH Advertising, Outdoor Signage Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

aS'NYC Mayor on City\'s Warp-Speed Wifi: "You Won\'t Need to Insert a Quarter in the Slot" | InverseExploreFollowInnovationDataShareSubscribeNYC Mayor on City\'s Warp-Speed Wifi: "You Won\'t Need to Insert a Quarter in the Slot"Mayor Bill de Blasio just officially rolled out LinkNYC: free, gigabit internet across the city.By Joe Carmichael on February 18, 2016Filed Under Fighting & SmartphonesNext time you\xe2\x80\x99re in New York, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to slip into a ubiquitous Starbucks for your free wifi. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio cut the virtual ribbon for the city\xe2\x80\x99s new program: LinkNYC. LinkNYC has plans to bring free, warp-speed wifi to all five boroughs, but for now, the kiosks, or \xe2\x80\x9clinks\xe2\x80\x9d are in Manhattan. This internet is faster than most anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experienced, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be all over the city. The program officially launched on January 19 in Manhattan, but in a sort of beta mode: the only enabled feature, until now, was the crazy-fast wifi. Starting Thursday, the Links also replace public payphones, offering free domestic calling in addition to \xe2\x80\x9ctwo USB charging ports, a tablet for accessing the internet, and a red 911 button to contact emergency services,\xe2\x80\x9d the press release announces. And more and more Links will be popping up across the city: by the end of July, there will be over 500 kiosks in all five boroughs; by mid-2019, there will be over 4,500 of them.Mayor de Blasio speaking to the press at the public unveiling of LinkNYC on Thursday.This program melds beautifully with one of De Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s passions: fighting for social and economic equality. Counsel to the Mayor Maya Wiley echoed this sentiment: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that low income New Yorkers, particularly African American and Latino residents, rely on their smartphones to get online. And now New Yorkers can reduce some of that broadband bill, no matter their zip code, at no cost to taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9dGetting free wifi 2 all is best boss @BilldeBlasio & best partners @colin_odonnell @ScottGoldsmith3 #LinkNYC pic.twitter.com/Xmr5BEahJD\xe2\x80\x94 Maya Wiley (@mayawiley) February 18, 2016\nThe rest of the city\xe2\x80\x99s press release was, naturally, filled with trumpeters and trumpet echoes, the redundancies of which are too amusing to exclude \xe2\x80\x94 plus, they do go some ways to tell you a bit more about what the program provides to both New Yorkers and tourists.Mayor de Blasio:LinkNYC is the Wi-Fi network New Yorkers deserve: the largest, fastest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world \xe2\x80\x94 and you won\xe2\x80\x99t need to insert a quarter in the slot, because it\xe2\x80\x99s completely free.\nCouncil Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito:LinkNYC takes another step by providing Wi-Fi hotspots all across the five boroughs to make internet accessibility more inclusive for all.\nBrooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams:By expanding access to the Internet from thousands of sites in our city, LinkNYC will keep New Yorkers connected.\nQueens Borough President Melinda Katz.:Folks are thrilled that free, citywide public Wi-Fi is well on its way.\nChief Technology Officer for the City of New York Minerva Tantoco:Just like the smartphone, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look back on the world before LinkNYC and wonder how we ever lived without it.\nUnion Square Partnership Executive Director Jennifer Falk:LinkNYC brings our public spaces into the 21st century, giving access to all and strengthening our great city\xe2\x80\x99s place as a global leader in technology, communication and media.\nSponsoredWHAT\'S THE GREENEST ROUTE FROM LA TO NYC??Join Shell for The Great Travel Hack, an energy conscious roadtrip across the country.Watch More \xc2\xbbCouncil Member James Vacca, Chair of the Committee on Technology:Who could argue with free Wi-Fi?

They said, people are dialing a number that for some odd reason, plays the jingle, and they leave it on speaker. Since the first crop of these prank calls, LinkNYC has blocked the number, and added an automatic 10-minute hang-up feature.\nOfficials pointed out that\xc2\xa0out of the 460,000 free calls made from LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s phone app every month, the most dialed number is the customer service line for the New York State Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card.\nIn a statement, they said, "We hope New Yorkers will allow their neighbors to access Links for these important services and not continue to misuse them for pranks.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNY1 asked for the alleged number that plays the jingle. LinkNYC has not provided it.\nREAD MORE\nLATEST NEWS\nCHANGE REGION\nCONTACT\nABOUT\nRSS\nFAQ\nSITEMAP\nCAREERS\nTERMS\nPRIVACY\nADVERTISE WITH US\n\xc2\xa9 1999-2019 Charter Communications.

LEWISMay 17, 2018\nSHARE:\nNew York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications Commissioner Samir Saini is just two months into his new job, but he already has big plans for his department. In an interview with City & State, Saini described how he plans to reshape the department while continuing to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s goal of providing broadband for all New Yorkers, from free public Wi-Fi to home broadband service. Saini also weighed in on cybersecurity in the city and his own transition from his previous role as Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s chief information officer.C&S: How is the OneNYC initiative to bring broadband to all New Yorkers going?SS: It\xe2\x80\x99s going well. There are different parts to the program. The first part is the effort to bring broadband on our streets, which is the public Wi-Fi, the high-speed public Wi-Fi strategy. And that is largely tied to the LinkNYC kiosks. So the Link deployments, things are going very well. We just briefed the City Council on this and we have another briefing as part of a budget hearing next week on it. But we have, as of today, about 1,500 Links, active Links deployed delivering, from what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting on average, about 300-350 megabit per second up and down with a 200-foot radius range from each Link. So we have 1,500 Links deployed, scattered across the boroughs and that\xe2\x80\x99s going quite well. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 3.5 million active subscribers using free, high-speed public Wi-Fi from the Links. And I think the other metric I just saw is we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing double-digit growth in the number of subscribers every year since we deployed the Links. So Link is going well. That\xe2\x80\x99s one piece.C&S: And the other pieces?SS: The other piece is broadband in the home. That\xe2\x80\x99s also moving forward. So broadband in the home is largely driven by DoITT\xe2\x80\x99s role to administer a set of franchise agreements. There are eight franchise agreements with cable providers. I guess the big issue there is broadband in the home, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really largely provided by two suppliers in the city: Verizon Fios and Charter/Spectrum. And what I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be seeing from DoITT as part of a strategic plan we\xe2\x80\x99re going to launch very soon, before July 1, is new strategies we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deploy to help accelerate the deployment of affordable broadband in the home, and the equitable distribution of it because there are parts of the city that don\xe2\x80\x99t have broadband. The Mayor\'s Office of the Chief Technology Officer just issued a broadband report two weeks ago that\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite enlightening. Some of the highlights over here are that, No. 1, roughly 31 percent of New Yorkers don\xe2\x80\x99t have broadband in the home today, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the equivalent to the entire population of the city of Houston. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. There\xe2\x80\x99s also issues around affordability for the current broadband services that are offered. And I think the obvious issue is there is a minimal level of choice for broadband. So all these things we\xe2\x80\x99re tackling, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see this in the strategic plan, ways in which we\xe2\x80\x99re going to change this game to deliver more equitable, affordable broadband to more New Yorkers to really hit the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s commitment of broadband for all New Yorkers by 2025.\nsamir-saini-headshot-submitted.jpg\nAlt Text:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiTitle Text:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiCaption:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiDescription:\xc2\xa0Samir SainiImage Credit:\xc2\xa0Submitted\nC&S: What can you tell me about ongoing difficulties with Charter/Spectrum? In what ways are they possibly violating their franchise agreement with the city?SS: There were two audits that we conducted against Spectrum. One was an audit that was financially related around evaluating how revenue was being calculated and generated. And the second audit was more on labor. And really the audits were meant to ensure and validate that Charter was in fact complying to the letter of the franchise agreement we have in place with them. So that\xe2\x80\x99s all public knowledge. On the financial audit, we asked for a bunch of financial data from Charter. They provided it ... and we\xe2\x80\x99re analyzing it. So that\xe2\x80\x99s in process. On the audit regarding whether they violated any labor issues, we made some initial findings, however there\xe2\x80\x99s other concerns from other entities around whether this is a violation of labor provisions within the franchise agreement that are still pending a final determination.C&S: You\xe2\x80\x99re fairly new to the job. What has your transition been like and what do you consider to be your most important role?SS: I\xe2\x80\x99m still two months in. But really, I\xe2\x80\x99ve broken down our core objectives into three parts. The first is going all-in into achieving digital equity for all New Yorkers. Digital equity implying equitably distributed, affordable broadband in every home, on every street, in every borough. The second one is really a focus on DoITT as a shared services provider. DoITT provides a set of IT services to serve our internal agencies. We have over 100 agencies that we support in different ways. So the first objective I\xe2\x80\x99ll have for our agency is to really transform ourselves more fully and entirely into operating like an external service company. Less a call center, internal service order taker. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a big cultural shift for us, but the idea is to really start transforming how we interact with agencies: treat them like customers, have a menu of services that are really easily understood and explainable and measurable. So it\xe2\x80\x99s really running our internal shop better than we do today and then transforming ourselves from order taker to a service management orientation.\nThe second objective is really around relooking at the services we provide to the agencies. We provide about 60 high-level services today \xe2\x80\x93 relooking at these 60, asking our customers, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat services do you want from us?\xe2\x80\x9d And then optimizing the service portfolio to align to the needs of the agencies today and what they\xe2\x80\x99ll need over the foreseeable future. This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened in a long time. Up to this point, DoITT has built its service portfolio based on random requests from different agencies. If you wanted a pizza, DoITT would figure out how to make a pizza and give you a pizza. If you wanted a hamburger, we\xe2\x80\x99d figure that out and give you a hamburger. If you wanted a steak, we did that. Now we have a kitchen and a bunch of chefs that can make all sorts of stuff. But the question is, should we? Or do we want to be a pizza joint? What do we actually want to be? It\xe2\x80\x99s a good problem to have because we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a lot of relationships and we have a wide menu, but it\xe2\x80\x99s now becoming a point where we want to be more strategic about what we want to put on our menu based on what really our customers want from us \xe2\x80\x93 especially if people aren\xe2\x80\x99t ordering burgers anymore.C&S: Cybersecurity has been a very large concern recently, especially with the upcoming elections. What is the city doing to shore up its defenses against cyberattacks?SS: There was a press release from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office announcing the preliminary budget that\xe2\x80\x99s going to the City Council for review over the next few weeks. In that budget is an inclusion for over $40 million dedicated for Geoff Brown and the new cyber command unit that\xe2\x80\x99s been set up. The cyber command unit, we call C3 under the citywide (chief information security officer) Geoff Brown, reports directly into the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office, the deputy mayor of operations, not to me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing because security is such a huge world these days that it requires its own agency, its own dedicated focus and that\xe2\x80\x99s where that lives. So the biggest thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is put money to it, and the money is really for staff and for tools to strengthen the city\xe2\x80\x99s ability to detect, to respond, to prevent threats from happening in the first place. It also is investments to ensure that we can continuously proactively check to find holes in the environment if any exist and close them before they\xe2\x80\x99re ever exploited by a bad actor externally. And so we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling really good about it. It takes investment and the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed budget provides exactly that.C&S: Is that different than other cities?SS: It is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other city that has that structure. Coming from me, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing because New York City isn\xe2\x80\x99t like any other city. The sheer complexity of what we do and how visible we are externally warrants that cybersecurity be its own entity and have its own separate investment and funding and resources. So I think the executive order Mayor de Blasio issued to create this organization last summer was absolutely the right move. And I think New York should feel really good that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing what other cities do. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking cybersecurity so seriously, we created a whole agency, and incremental new funding dedicated to it to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re safe.C&S: A couple months ago, there was a huge cyberattack that crippled Atlanta. Do you think that having a New York City approach to cybersecurity could have prevented or at minimized the damage of that attack?SS: I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I mean, the reality of what happened in Atlanta and also what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in other cities is just not being, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hitting the news unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in the CIO circuit, is that those kinds of threats, especially that one ... can\xe2\x80\x99t be prevented. (Editor\'s note: After this interview was published, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications clarified that Saini meant\xc2\xa0that such threats are "very hard to prevent.")\xc2\xa0The key is to have an administration that prioritizes cybersecurity. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it that way. And investments in cybersecurity in particular are really critical regardless of how it\xe2\x80\x99s structured. In Atlanta, I think Mayor (Keisha Lance) Bottoms publicly said that she had not made cybersecurity a priority. That\xe2\x80\x99s her words. But now, after the attack, it is her No. 1 priority. So I think the mayor is doing absolutely the right thing, which is way before, this is last year, before the Atlanta attack and actually several other attacks that occurred in other cities affecting critical infrastructure, public safety infrastructure, transportation infrastructure. California got affected. He saw the writing on the wall and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do this differently,\xe2\x80\x9d which is where C3 was born.C&S: You were CIO in Atlanta before coming to New York City. How different has it been to come from a place where, as you said, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t initially a priority to a place where it is?SS: Part of why I had left is first off, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually from New Jersey. So, in part, this was a move home. But the other is, there was a leadership change happening in Atlanta, there was a new mayor coming it. It was a logical time for me to depart. But also, there was minimal \xe2\x80\x93 I felt like Atlanta had hit a point where they were not investing as much as I would have wanted them to in moving on a number of areas, scaling out smart city initiatives we had, but also in the cyber space. So it was really a mixed bag of reasons, but moving here to New York, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a real blessing because I think this city and this mayor really understands and values IT. Not to say they didn\xe2\x80\x99t in Atlanta, but certainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal here. In large part I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because the operations of New York City are so complex and affect so many people that technology plays an even more critical role in the delivery of the services to the 8.7 million people that live here, less so the 500,000 people that live in Atlanta. So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot more focus and dependence on it, and a lot more investment and appreciation for IT and our services.C&S: And you said the kind of attack that happened in Atlanta isn\xe2\x80\x99t really preventable. Is it a concern that it could happen in New York City?SS: Yes. There\xe2\x80\x99s multiple types of cyberattacks that occur all the time. So I would be the first to tell you, and no one could disagree with this, no city, no state, no private sector entity is immune from any of these. Period. If anyone thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re well-protected, well, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that publicly because they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be a target. If you talk to the cybersecurity experts out there, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 that the game now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about investing in services to protect yourself from ever having an attack. Everyone needs to accept that there will be an attack. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of when. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of how bad. And the question really will be, how ready are you, as a city or as a private sector company, to detect it and remediate it, and to strengthen your defenses so if it happens again, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be as bad, or that kind of attack won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. It\xe2\x80\x99s about containment and response and then strengthening your defenses next time. No one is immune. It just so happens that Atlanta got hit, but when was the last time Atlanta was hit? Never. Because we did several other things, at least over the course of my time there, where we could have gotten hit 10 times because we had legacy infrastructure and all sorts of holes. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those things where you\xe2\x80\x99re never 100 percent safe. Nobody is 100 percent safe from a cyberattack. Anyone who says they are, I would worry about.\nRelated Stories\nNew York CityA look at DoITT\'s new Text-to-911 emergency response initiativeBy GRACE SEGERS\nTechnologyThe next frontier: A Q&A with DoITT Commissioner Anne RoestBy FRANK G.

It is creating and enabling it." said Heather Letzkus\xc2\xa0who has a birds-eye view of the kiosk from her apartment window above and has overheard countless meet ups, and watched callers return to linger at the kiosk visibly drugged out.\nThe kiosk is located about half a block from 177 Huron St. a house that\'s been on the radar of local authorities for months, according to Councilman Stephen Levin\'s office.\n"It seems to be a drug den of some kind," said Ben Solotaire, a staffer at Levin\'s office.\nPolice have logged eight complaints since March at 177 Huron St, records show. They\'ve made five arrests at the address for criminal possession\xc2\xa0of controlled substance, assault, strangulation, menacing, records show.\nMost recently,\xc2\xa0Emil Slevin, 54, whose family owns the house according to property records,\xc2\xa0was cuffed on Sept. 9 for pouring acid on another man, prosecutors said.\nSlevin was being held on Rikers Island on $5,000 which he hadn\'t posted and was due back in court on Oct. 12. His Legal Aid Attorney declined to comment on the charges immediately.\nArlene Mocko, 47, who was arrested there in March for drug possession, was re-arrested on Aug. 25 after she pushed into\xc2\xa0Letzkus\' building demanding to use the bathroom, Letzkus said. Mocko\xc2\xa0had been making a loud call at the wireless kiosk warning the person on the other line about a police car on the block before the incident, Letzkus said.\nPolice found\xc2\xa0Mocko\xc2\xa0with a crack pipe with cocaine in it, prosecutors said. She\'s now\xc2\xa0facing trespassing, drug possession and harassment charges. She was released on her own recognizance and is due back in court on Oct. 19.\nMocko, who couldn\'t be reached for comment immediately is raising $5,000 on GoFundMe to buy a car and leave the city and describes struggling with addiction.\nLevin\'s office has received several complaints about other LinkNYC\xc2\xa0kiosks along Manhattan Avenue residents have said become flashpoints\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0loitering, loud behavior, catcalling, and arranging drug deals, Solotaire\xc2\xa0said.\nSince their July installation, the LinkNYC\xc2\xa0kiosks are the latest\xc2\xa0flashpoint along Manhattan Avenue, where citywide and nationwide issues of homelessness and opioid addition\xc2\xa0have manifested themselves on a very local level.\nClay Street nearby has two homeless shelters, and the director has\xc2\xa0voiced concerns about how easy access to heroin in the area has caused residents who hadn\'t used in years to relapse.\nBusiness owners along the block worry that the kiosks have brought with them a host of unintended consequences.\n"It\'s becoming a\xc2\xa0physical mess to clean up," said Adam Saucy, the owner of Odd Fox Coffee said daily he has to sweep up, "McDonald\'s meals, bottles, cans, paper, bags...half-eaten turned over pizza."\n"If I had it my way this thing\xc2\xa0would be gone," he said, declining to give his age.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do understand the public good of having these things,\xe2\x80\x9d Saucy said, but he added,\xc2\xa0"it\xe2\x80\x99s causing problems that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people anticipated or were very prepared to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRecord Grouch co-owner Brian Gempp\xc2\xa0wrote they often hear\xc2\xa0loud arguments between people waiting to use the kiosk and keeps customers from browsing their records out front.\nSince LinkNYC\xc2\xa0kiosks\xc2\xa0were debuted in Manhattan neighborhoods starting in early 2016, Manhattan residents have complained the kiosks were being used as a place for people to post up and drink and use drugs\xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0organize drug deals.\nLinkNYC was forced to disable the\xc2\xa0wireless browsing capabilities in September of 2016\xc2\xa0after numerous complaints about people using them to watch pornography.\xc2\xa0Loitering complaints dropped by 96 percent after that, according to LinkNYC spokeswoman\xc2\xa0Ruth Fasoldt.\n"In Greenpoint alone, there were more than 163,000 wi-fi sessions in August and Link has worked with\xc2\xa0local businesses to offer affordable advertising on the Links\xe2\x80\x99 55-inch digital displays,\xe2\x80\x9d Fasoldt said.\n"Anyone who sees illegal activity on their street should call 911," she added.\nIn early 2016 more than 1,000 kiosks have been installed across the city with thousands more coming, the company said.\nTwitter\nFacebook\nEmail\nMore\nNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick48,000 Students With Disabilities Not Getting Help They Need, DOE AdmitsNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickWilliamsburg\'s Controversial Pfizer Rezoning Approved by City CouncilNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickTerrorist Planned to Continue Killing Spree at Brooklyn Bridge, Feds SayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickDriver Killed in Crash While Exiting Williamsburg Bridge, Police SayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick8 Dead in Terrorist Truck Driver\'s Bike Path Rampage, Officials SayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickVIDEO: Even Bernie Sanders is Fed Up With Waiting for the SubwayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickCity Set to Repeal \'Racist\' Anti-Dancing Cabaret Law TuesdayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickVIDEO: Gunman Opens Fire Inside Bushwick Bodega, NYPD SaysNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickElderly Woman\'s Decomposed Body Found at Newtown Creek, Officials SayNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickSubsidized Apts Starting at $670 Up For Grabs on Bustling Grand StreetNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick$8M School Anti-Bullying Plan Will Make it Easier for Students to TransferNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & BushwickVIDEO: Man Critically Hurt by Hit-and-Run Driver in Williamsburg, NYPD SaysNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick$200-an-Hour Tutor Offering Gifted-and-Talented Test Prep for FreeNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick45 MPH Winds Expected to Lash City After Weekend Rain Dumps 3 InchesNext in Williamsburg, Greenpoint & Bushwick17 Subway Lines Slated For Service Changes This Weekend\nRecommended\nTriBeCa \xc2\xbb\n48,000 Students With Disabilities Not Getting Help They Need, DOE Admits\nProspect Heights \xc2\xbb\n\'Affordable\' Apartments End Up on StreetEasy After Housing Lottery Flops\nCivic Center \xc2\xbb\nNew York City Collects Record $1.9 Billion in Fines and Fees\nPark Slope \xc2\xbb\n4 Injured When Car Jumps Curb in Park Slope, FDNY Says\nDNAinfo is New York\'s leading neighborhood news source.

The city Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and Citybridge \xe2\x80\x94 the organization that will install new LinkNYC kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 are applying to continue deployment of the multi-use terminals on the Upper West Side. The targeted locations are: 2 Columbus Avenue between West 59th and 60th streets;111 West 60 Street on the corner of Columbus Avenue;40 Columbus Avenue near West 61st Street;322 Columbus Avenue between West 75th and 76th streets;100 West 77th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus avenues.Thousands of LinkNYC kiosks have been installed across New York City, many of them on the Upper West Side, in a venture to replace outdated payphones. The terminals provide free wi-fi access, phone charging and assistance with directions. The terminals have also been deployed for more creative uses such as sending Valentines Day messages and functioning as bus countdown clocks.\nWhile the kiosks have their uses, there has been some negative backlash. Some people simply don't like how they look, and internet browsing was removed from the terminals because some New Yorkers were using them to watch porn in public.

The company is aiming for a total of 7,500 Links by 2026.CreditCreditCole Wilson for The New York TimesBy Keith WilliamsJan. 11, 2018Q. Tall kiosks labeled \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x9d are replacing phone booths, offering free Wi-Fi and nationwide phone calls. The thing is, I have never seen anybody using one. What gives?A. Compared with the pay phones they often replace, LinkNYC kiosks, known as Links, get plenty of use, even if no one is standing next to them.According to CityBridge, the consortium that operates LinkNYC, over 3.2 million people have registered for the system\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi service, with 600,000 users each week. The Wi-Fi operates at gigabit speed, meaning it can be up to 100 times faster than cellular LTE networks. The range of a Link is about 150 feet in any direction.Links are a critical piece in the city\xe2\x80\x99s goal to bring broadband internet access to all New Yorkers, but the system\xe2\x80\x99s community-first approach provides other social benefits, as well.Each Link has an interactive screen, which offers everyday information you might expect, like weather, local maps, and transit updates, as well as a connection to the city\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service. Through a partnership with the software program Aunt Bertha, however, users can anonymously search for nonprofit and social services.Links also offer free phone calls anywhere in the country; the system registers around 200,000 calls each month. The number dialed most frequently? The state\xe2\x80\x99s hotline for its Electronic Benefits Transfer program, commonly known as food stamps.Since the system launched in early 2016, around 1,250 Links have been erected throughout all five boroughs. The company is aiming for a total of 7,500 Links by 2026, when its contract with the city is scheduled to expire.As the first system of its kind, LinkNYC has faced unforeseen difficulties. When the system was introduced, each Link offered an internet browser. But a slew of complaints of users camping out in front of the units and, in some cases, viewing inappropriate content, caused the system to remove that functionality.The system\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge is finding new locations, said Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC. The system is building a new fiber-optic network, but not every pay phone site is close enough to a manhole to connect to it.Links generate revenue through advertisements, which appear on the 55-inch screens on the sides of each kiosk. These ads are interspersed with in-house content like \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and historical photos of nearby locations. LinkNYC and the city split the ad revenue equally, subject to an annual minimum.The idea is expanding to other cities: Links have begun appearing in the United Kingdom, and are set to arrive in Philadelphia this summer.The system is in a constant state of refinement, with temporary options ranging from time-sensitive to whimsical. Through Jan. 31, for example, users can browse and enroll in health care plans; in December, each Link offered a direct line to Santa\xe2\x80\x99s voice mail.EMAIL fyi@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on , on Page MB3 of the New York edition.

aS"LinkNYC Kiosks Adopt Aunt Bertha Social Services App - CityLab\nSkip to content\nDesign Transportation Environment Equity Life\nLinkNYC's new Aunt Bertha app connects users with information about food pantries, emergency housing, and other social services. LinkNYC\nNew York City's Wi-Fi Kiosks Now Include a 'Yelp for Social Services'\nLaura Bliss\nApr 13, 2017\nThe move targets New Yorkers who stand to benefit most from the LinkNYC network in the first place. Share Tweet LinkedInEmailPrint\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no blueprint for how to roll out the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest free public wi-fi network\xe2\x80\x94especially one with hundreds of web-beaming, touch-screen towers spread across five boroughs. So a little more than a year after LinkNYC installed its first kiosks around New York City, some questions are still hazy. How are they supposed to be used? Who are they really meant for?\nToday LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s purpose takes a slightly clearer shape, with the addition of Aunt Bertha, an existing app modeled as a Yelp for social safety-net services run by an Austin-based benefit corporation. LinkNYC kiosks are already equipped with access to 911 and 311, a portal to apply for government benefits, interactive maps, free phone-call capabilities, and a USB charger. Through a simple search from one of the kiosk tablets, New Yorkers can now tap into Aunt Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s robust database of food pantries, emergency housing, childcare, healthcare, transportation assistance, and financial aid programs located within that zip code.\nRecommended\nTo Court a Skeptical Public, New York Sends Wi-Fi Ambassadors\nEillie Anzilotti Aug 12, 2016\nA Portland Startup Is Smashing Barriers to Affordable Housing Laura Bliss Jan 27, 2017\nNew Place Names Lift M\xc4\x81ori Culture in New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s Capital Chris Fitch 8:00 AM ET\nThe app targets the New Yorkers who stand the most to gain from LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s services in the first place. A 2015 study by the city comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office found that roughly 813,000 households (nearly 26 percent, citywide) lacked broadband access at home; 510,000 don\xe2\x80\x99t have a computer.\nThe majority of these disconnected households are surviving below the poverty line, and may benefit from the resources Aunt Bertha is designed to catalogue and serve up with ease. Founded in 2012, the platform has connected more than 280,000 people around the U.S. with services from all tiers of government, large nonprofit agencies, and neighborhood groups\xe2\x80\x94the sorts of resources otherwise buried across thousands of websites and pamphlets that can require hours or days of sifting to find.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople in need are almost always grappling with interrelated problems\xe2\x80\xa6 so easily accessible powerful technology tools that provide useful options in one place are key,\xe2\x80\x9d Steve Lee, a managing director at Robin Hood, a New York City anti-poverty agency, said in a statement.\nWhether New Yorkers will bite, of course, is the big-ticket question. LinkNYC has logged more than a million registered users on its wi-fi network since the kiosks first rolled out in February 2016. However, the offerings have shifted substantially: Initially, the touch-screens offered unfettered web-browsing, but that feature quickly got axed when the lure of YouTube (and porn sites) proved too disruptive to sidewalk life. And not all New Yorkers have taken enthusiastically to the 2001 Space Odyssey-like monoliths, which are owned and operated by a consortium of public and private entities with Alphabet at the center. Data privacy concerns, especially in low-income neighborhoods already experiencing disproportionate levels of police surveillance, have held plenty of users back.\nRepresentatives for LinkNYC say that the kiosks themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t require log-ins (though the wi-fi network does), and wipe any personal information entered at the end of each session. Usage data from the Aunt Bertha app, they say, will be aggregated to guide searchers to services that might be the most in-demand where they are. LinkNYC also continues to work with community groups, local libraries, youth groups, and seniors organizations to reach groups that could benefit from the services. Meanwhile, the network will continue to expand. Currently, there are a little over 800 kiosks around the city; LinkNYC expects 7,500 total by 2025.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart\xe2\x80\x9d technology will never solve wicked problems like urban poverty, hunger, transportation gaps, and healthcare divides on its own\xe2\x80\x94focused policies and targeted investments have to work in tandem.

aS'New York adds bus info to LinkNYC kiosks, starting in Brooklyn | StateScoop\nSubscribe\nAbout\nRSS\nBrought to you by\nSpecial Reports\nState\nCity\nCounty & Local\nWatch\nListen\nAttend\nContent Studio\nNew York adds bus info to LinkNYC kiosks, starting in Brooklyn\nShare\nWritten by Benjamin Freed\nApr 5, 2018 | STATESCOOP\nSince early 2016, New York City has installed about 1,700 LinkNYC kiosks\xc2\xa0offering free Wi-Fi, mobile-device charging stations, and access to city services where now-antiquated phone booths once stood. As of this week, 29 kiosks in Brooklyn will now display real-time\xc2\xa0bus schedules, city officials announced Wednesday, with the updates spreading to the rest of the city not long after.\nThe bus-information upgrade was announced by LinkNYC, which is privately operated and managed by the Citybridge consortium;\xc2\xa0the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of\xc2\xa0Information Technology and Telecommunications;\xc2\xa0and City Council member Brad Lander, who\xc2\xa0represents neighborhoods like Park Slope and Cobble Hill. The initial 29\xc2\xa0kiosks getting the bus information are all in\xc2\xa0Lander\xe2\x80\x99s district.\nKiosks will show pedestrians which bus lines they\xe2\x80\x99re on, and how many stops away the nearest bus is, with the relevant information being dowloaded from the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The arrival times will be shown on the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 55-inch digital screens. Citybridge, a group\xc2\xa0of advertising and communications companies, also sells ads on the displays.\nCity officials boast of LinkNYC having one of the quickest internet connections in New York, with the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 broadcasting gigabit-speed Wi-Fi that\xe2\x80\x99s 100 times faster than typical public wireless and 40 times faster than the average home connection, according to the service\xe2\x80\x99s website.\nThe\xc2\xa0Android tablet computers implanted in each kiosk already allowed users to access city maps and social services. The kiosks also support phones that offer free domestic phone calls. Along with the free wireless internet and device charging, city officials estimate LinkNYC has already been used 3.5 million times since the first kiosks were installed, with Wi-Fi users going through more than 3,625 terabytes of data. CIVIQ, which\xc2\xa0manufactures the kiosks,\xc2\xa0has also\xc2\xa0deployed them in\xc2\xa0London, and similar\xc2\xa0systems are being planned in Chicago and Miami.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom voter registration to healthcare enrollment, and now with real-time bus information on Brooklyn kiosks, LinkNYC has once again proven to be more than just fast and free Wi-Fi,\xe2\x80\x9d DoITT Commissioner Samir Saini says in a press release.\nLander may have more of a rooting interest in getting the real-time bus information on the kiosks. Many of his\xc2\xa0constituents might soon be familiarizing themselves with their local bus schedules in preparation for next year\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled shutdown of the subway\xe2\x80\x99s L train, a vital link for Brooklynites headed into Manhattan.\nCity officials do not expect the Brooklyn pilot to last more than a few weeks before the real-time bus information spreads to the rest of the kiosk network. The pilot is mostly to make sure the bus schedules are functioning properly and meeting user-experience requirements. LinkNYC also\xc2\xa0plans to collect direct\xc2\xa0feedback from users who are frequent bus passengers.\n-In this Story-\nCivic Tech, Digital Services, LinkNYC, New York, New York City, Samir Saini, State & Local News, States, Tech News, Transportation\nRelated news\nCity\nNew York City hires Obama administration tech adviser as CTO\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 1 min ago\nCity\nWhy local governments should lead multi-jurisdiction disaster response\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 3 hours ago\nCity\nSt. Louis IT agency revised security policies after audit, CIO says\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 1 day ago\nAd Specs\nSponsor\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Scoop News Group\n|\nAll Rights Reserved\nSearch for:\nThe latest state and local government tech news, delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

Link, the company behind the kiosks, is even offering to help New Yorkers "set up a special proposal" using the screens. But anyone popping the question might have to shuffle around other people charging their phones or making phone calls. "LinkNYC\'s digital displays feature fun facts about New York City, historic photos, important PSAs, and advertising that keeps our services free for all," Link President Jen Hensley said in a statement. "This Valentine\'s Day, you can use it to tell someone you love them \xe2\x80\x94 and even propose." The attempt at romance is Link\'s latest holiday-themed display on the kiosks, which had internet browsers until people reportedly spent hours camped out next to them playing music or watching smutty videos. The kiosks still allow free phone calls, maps and wireless internet connections. The company thinks it\'s solved that problem \xe2\x80\x94 loitering complaints dropped by 96 percent "immediately" after the web browsers were pulled in September 2016, a Link spokesman said.\nLink staff will review every tagged Instagram photo to make sure it\'s not too risque before putting it goes on the screens, the spokesman said. But every appropriate picture will likely be featured. Link will ask users for permission before broadcasting their photos, the company says.\nAnyone who wants to take the next step and propose with the LinkNYC screens should email hello@link.nyc.

"It will be the biggest and fastest network in the world and completely free of charge."\nOver a dozen of these hubs, or "Links," are already operational on street corners in Manhattan. There will be 510 Links installed in all five of New York City\'s main boroughs by July. And eventually there will be over 7,500 Links accessible to the 8.5 million citizens of the city that never sleeps.\n"In 2016 internet access is not a luxury," de Blasio said. "It\'s not something optional. It\'s something everybody needs."\nLinkNYC isn\'t the first project to bring free public WiFi to an entire city \xe2\x80\x94 cities around the world like Taipei and Helsinki already offer free public WiFi that\'s faster than the internet service many Americans pay for at home. But LinkNYC is the only public WiFi network of its scale that\'s promising gigabit internet speeds, the fastest kind of connection that\'s commercially available.\nGigabit is so fast \xe2\x80\x94 you can download an HD movie in 7 seconds \xe2\x80\x94 that the latest iPhone isn\'t even capable of accessing half of its available speed. "For the first time in the history of the internet, your device is the bottleneck," Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC, told Tech Insider.\nHuge advertising opportunities balanced with privacy concerns\nCityBridge\nLinkNYC is set up to be completely funded by advertising and will cost nothing to the user or taxpayers. Hensley, who is employed by Intersection, the parent company of LinkNYC, stressed that the goal of the network is to offer a "pure internet experience," which means ads won\'t actually be shown on your device.\nInstead, ads will be displayed on the two 55-inch screens on the sides of each Link. Hensley described the advertising model as "definitely a first of its kind." Over the life of its 12-year contract \xe2\x80\x94 which promises 4,500 Link installations in four years and eventually more than 7,000 Links total \xe2\x80\x94 LinkNYC expects to eventually generate over $500 million in revenue through ad partnerships and sponsorships. That\'s quite a bit more than the $40 million a year existing phone booth ads generate. LinkNYC\'s own network deployment costs are expected to cost $200 million.\nThe appeal for businesses, especially local merchants that wish to advertise a sale or happy hour down the block, is obvious. "We think it will work," Hensley said. "We think the scale of digital advertising in New York, one of the world\'s biggest media markets, is extremely compelling."\nLinkNYC\'s network will help advertisers tap into foot traffic around specific neighborhoods. Hensley stressed that even though certain data is collected on an aggregate level, LinkNYC isn\'t snooping on all of the web traffic that goes through its network \xe2\x80\x94 for now.\n"We have access to some, not all of that data," she said. "We\'re not monitoring what websites people go to right now. That\'s not currently part of the strategy. But we will gain insights into how people use the network and how people move through the city. And we think that\'s where there\'s a lot of value."\nCityBridge\nWhen pressed about exactly the kind of user data LinkNYC accesses, Miles Green, the director of infrastructure engineering at Intersection, said anonymous information will be gathered from devices that connect to the network to help inform advertisers.\n"We will use anonymous, aggregated information from device IDs about area demographics to build profiles of specific locations that\'s valuable to advertisers," Green said. "We could understand if an area skews male or female, and we\'ll know, for example, if the Nets are playing or there\'s a Justin Bieber concert happening at the Barclay\'s Center. We will never sell personal information or share with third- parties for their own use."\nBeyond advertisers, the data that will funnel through LinkNYC\'s network will be a gold mine for any company or hacker looking to get their hands on someone\'s personal information.\nThat\'s why LinkNYC has a separate WiFi network it\'s offering that\'s encrypted. Anyone can join the main public network, but that runs the risk of having any non-encrypted web traffic (anything without the little padlock icon next to the URL in your web browser) exposed to others. "This is the risk of an open network anywhere," Green said. Each Link tower will have a dedicated button for dialing 911, a headphone jack, keypad for making free phone calls, and USB ports for charging.\nCityBridge\nOnly iPhones and iPads can get on LinkNYC\'s private, encrypted network for now due to Android\'s lack of support for technology called Hotspot 2.0, which the network uses to authenticate with devices. Besides the added safety, another benefit of the encrypted network is that once you\'ve joined at one Link, your Apple device will automatically connect whenever it gets near any Link in the city.\nLinkNYC is able to facilitate this digital handshake by installing its own certificate on iPhones, which the user has to manually approve with his or her passcode. The certificate installation process used by LinkNYC may be convenient, but such certificates are capable of infecting Apple devices with malware, according to Will Strafach, an experienced iPhone hacker and CEO of mobile security firm Sudo Security. "It\'s not good for run of the mill users," he said. "You don\'t want them getting used to installing certificates. They should view any certificate that\'s trying to be installed as potentially sketchy."\nGreen, Intersection\'s director of infrastructure engineering, said that the certificate used by LinkNYC is safe and only intended to encrypt web traffic. "You do want to think twice when you\'re installing something on your machine, but we\'ve done everything we can to ensure that we\'re doing it in the way that the internet secures itself," he said. "It\'s the same kind of process that you use when you visit a website to validate the authenticity of something." He also acknowledged that the need for a certificate to access the encrypted network will not be required as soon as it\'s technically possible to remove.\nThe smart city of the future LinkNYC\'s WiFi hubs will eventually be working in all 5 of New York City\'s boroughs.\nSidewalk Labs\n34 million Americans, or 10% of the U.S. population, still don\'t have basic broadband access,\naccording to the FCC.\nA 2014 study by the city of New York found that nearly 30% of citizens lacked internet connectivity faster than dial-up.\nAnd LinkNYC won\'t replace broadband at home for most people. Each Link tower only has a signal radius of 150 feet, which means that the network is strictly intended for public use. But given how ridiculously fast and easy to use the network is, Links could become sought after pockets of WiFi that save people from cellular data plan caps and signal drop-outs.\nWhen you begin to look at all of the players involved, making it easier for people to get online is only a piece of what LinkNYC is about. Mapping web traffic patterns and the ebb and flow of devices as they move through the city could inform everything from smart cars to law enforcement. "I really think it\'s about order of magnitude change in what citizens can expect from the streets of their city," Intersection\'s Hensley said.\nAll roads lead back to Google\nCityBridge\nThe roots of LinkNYC can be traced all the way back to Alphabet, the multi-billion-dollar tech conglomerate that owns Google.\nIn May 2014, the de Blasio Administration announced a competition for proposals on how to replace New York\'s thousands of old payphones with state-of-the-art WiFi hubs. Six months later, it announced that the winner of the multi-year-long contract was LinkNYC.\nAt the time, the two main companies behind LinkNYC were Control Group, a tech and advertising consulting firm, and Titan, the outdoor advertising giant responsible for all of the ads on the city\'s existing payphones.\nSkye Gould / Tech Insider\nIt wasn\'t until September 2015 that Sidewalk Labs, an urban development startup created by Google (before it was called in Alphabet), came into the picture. Under the leadership of Dan Doctoroff, who previously served as president of Bloomberg LP and was New York City\'s deputy mayor of economic development, Sidewalk Labs led the merger of Control Group and Titan to become a single entity called Intersection.\nTo add another layer of corporate complexity to the mix, Intersection partnered with CIVIQ Smartspaces, Qualcomm, and Antenna to create a consortium called CityBridge, a group directly responsible for everything from designing the Link towers to maintaining its robust network.\nWithin CityBridge, Intersection is responsible for the day-to-day management and deployment of LinkNYC\'s aggressive rollout.\nSidewalk Labs provides financial support \xe2\x80\x94 it remains a minority investor \xe2\x80\x94 as well as guidance from Doctoroff, who also serves as chairman of Intersection. And most importantly, the startup\'s staff can provide expertise in navigating the government bureaucracy and stringent regulations LinkNYC has managed to fly through in less than a year.\nSidewalk Labs is developing what Doctoroff calls the "completely connected streets" platform, "which would collect ground data from streets and sidewalks to inform decisions about things like parking, lane-changing, and traffic-enforcement,"\naccording to Business Insider.\nOutside of LinkNYC, Sidewalk is currently working with 10 cities on the U.S. Department of Transportation\'s "Smart City Challenge," which plans to fund "bold, data-driven ideas to improve lives by making transportation safer, easier, and more reliable." Links are equipped with Bluetooth beacon technology that can track phones and other devices as they move through the city (it\'s an opt-in process), which could eventually make Sidewalk\'s other initiatives smarter.\nAlphabet\'s connection to LinkNYC may be distant on paper, but its involvement is obvious in the end product millions of residents and tourists will come into contact with on the streets of New York. Besides a USB charging port and phone number dialing pad powered by Vonage, each Link has its own Android tablet with free access to Google Maps and Google search.\nNOW WATCH: Here are all of Google\'s awesome science projects \xe2\x80\x94 that we know about\nMore:\nLinkNYC\nSidewalk Labs\nDan Doctoroff\nInteresection\nTI Graphics\nPopular\nThe best smartphone maker you\'ve never heard of is announcing a new smartphone in May that\'s expected to have a more advanced display than the iPhone or Galaxy S10\nPopular\nChina shows off its new destroyer during massive display of naval power\nPopular\nI drove a $45,000 Ford Ranger pickup truck to see if it\'s ready to take on the Chevy Colorado and Toyota Tacoma \xe2\x80\x94 here\'s the verdict\nPopular\nTim Cook said Apple\'s fight with the FBI in 2016 was a \'very rigged case,\' and he wishes it went to court\nPopular\nI have 26 credit cards and excellent credit.

But he spent the rest of the day emulating Trump\xe2\x80\x99s playbook, attacking a scoop from our Sally Goldenberg about his plans to tear down two of NYCHA\xe2\x80\x99s 11 Fulton Houses in Chelsea and build new mixed-income housing as "rumors and misinformation," before he was ultimately forced to admit by day\'s end that every detail was accurate. Under the city\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, residents would be moved to two new buildings on an adjacent parking lot before the demolition of the towers took place, and would relocate to the new mixed-income building after its construction.\nIn the long and tortured history of public housing, one constant is a fear of poor people somehow being evicted from their homes. As The Root\xe2\x80\x99s Dara Sharif wrote yesterday, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk any native New Yorkers, especially black and brown New Yorkers, and \xe2\x80\x98word on the street\xe2\x80\x99 has long been the notion that with gentrification would come the demolition of public housing, long the place many poorer black and brown New Yorkers have called home.\xe2\x80\x9d Story Continued Below\nSome Fulton Houses residents don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the mayor when he tries to reassure them they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stay.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make those high risers and just forget about us,\xe2\x80\x9d one resident told NY1. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the tenants in my building are not leaving. At least not without a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen he first took office back in 2014, de Blasio promised that any development on NYCHA land would take place with the input of public housing residents.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to consider development is with the tenants,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said then. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a way we can find a responsible platform with tenants that is transparent, when there\xe2\x80\x99s real guarantees what the benefits will be to the tenants in the immediate area, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very worthy proposal to discuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s since embraced the idea he once criticized, put forward by Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s administration, to allow market rate development on NYCHA land, and argued the problem with Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s idea wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the developments themselves, but the way the former mayor failed to adequately discuss his administration\xe2\x80\x99s plans with public housing tenants.\nA major problem with Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s plan, de Blasio said last year, was \xe2\x80\x9cthere were a number of things missing when it came to talking about development on a NYCHA land site and things that really caused people real concern, legitimate frustration.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow the mayor is facing the daunting task of getting buy-in from residents terrified of having their homes taken away. Can he convince Fulton Houses residents and city elected officials that his idea is a great one? Or will he retreat at the first signs of opposition?\nIT\xe2\x80\x99S TUESDAY.

The billionaire Clinique chairman \xe2\x80\x94 a 1961 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science \xe2\x80\x94 is prepared to spend at least \'seven figures\' of his personal fortune on TV commercials and other efforts to block de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s controversial proposal, sources said.\nThe campaign will target Albany lawmakers, whom the mayor needs to amend a 1971 state law that created the Specialized High School Admission Test \xe2\x80\x94 and may even include attack ads against de Blasio, one source said. ... The group\xe2\x80\x99s efforts are being spearheaded by political strategist Bradley Tusk, who in 2015 helped Uber defeat de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s plan to limit the company\xe2\x80\x99s expansion. Tusk fired the first shot Monday morning with a press release announcing that Kirsten John Foy, a former regional director for Al Sharpton\xe2\x80\x99s National Action Network, was among the founding members of the Education Equity Campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d New York Post\xe2\x80\x99s Carl Campanile and Bruce Golding\n\xe2\x80\x94via @MadinaToure: Tusk Strategies is managing the overall effort and is getting $7,500 a month. Education Equity has $125,000 in contracts w/three lobbying firms \xe2\x80\x94 Bolton-St. Johns, Patrick B. Jenkins & Associates and Blue Suit Strategies \xe2\x80\x94 to support its plan.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA PROMINENT TOXICOLOGIST who lost her job after calling for more transparency about a controversial form of DNA testing won a $1 million settlement from the city on Monday. Marina Stajic said she was fired on April 9, 2015, because she voted in favor of publicly releasing an internal Office of Chief Medical Examiner study on \xe2\x80\x98low copy number\xe2\x80\x99 DNA testing, which analyzes small amounts of genetic material. Critics have said the form of DNA testing \xe2\x80\x94 which the city has since abandoned \xe2\x80\x94 may have led to wrongful convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d Daily News\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Rex Brown\n\xe2\x80\x9cPROSECUTORS ACROSS THE CITY ARE USING SECRET SPREADSHEETS to identify cops who could have trouble on the witness stand because they\xe2\x80\x99ve been sued, arrested, accused of misconduct or testified suspiciously in the past \xe2\x80\xa6 District attorneys offices in Manhattan, Brooklyn and The Bronx have maintained internal databases for several years, while the Queens DA\xe2\x80\x99s Office created one last year and the Staten Island DA\xe2\x80\x99s Office is developing one, sources said.

But now multiple former candidates are launching or considering second bids for office. \xe2\x80\x98I think in the last election, we did everything in our power to fight him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Nate McMurray, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Republican Chris Collins last year. \xe2\x80\x98He fought dirty against us. He did everything he could to undermine who I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be perfectly frank, I want another chance to fight against him...\xe2\x80\x99 Collins is still under indictment for insider trading, but continues to represent a deeply Republican House district (NY-27) in western New York\xe2\x80\xa6\nMcMurray could soon join an increasingly long list of former candidates already launching second campaigns this year. Democrat Tedra Cobb announced she plans to once again challenge Republican Elise Stefanik in the North Country (NY-21). Democrat Tracy Mitrano wants to again face off against Republican Tom Reed in the Southern Tier (NY-23). Republican former U.S. Senate candidate Chele Farley has started to raise money to challenge Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney in the Hudson Valley (NY-18). Democrat Perry Gershon is considering another challenge to Rep. Lee Zeldin (NY-1).\nRepublican former Rep. Michael Grimm, who failed in a primary bid last year to retake his Staten Island House seat, is eyeing another run against incumbent Democrat Max Rose (NY-11). But he may face Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who ran for New York City mayor against Bill de Blasio in 2015. Just last week, in central New York, Dana Balter launched her second bid to oust Republican John Katko for a Syracuse-area House seat (NY-24).\xe2\x80\x9d Spectrum News\xe2\x80\x99s Nick Reisman\nSOCIAL DATA\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: John Oliver is 42 ...

The plan, which requires legislation in the City Council, is part of what he termed his own Green New Deal. \xe2\x80\x98Buildings got built that should never have been built to begin with, if we were thinking about the needs of our Earth,\xe2\x80\x99 the mayor said. \xe2\x80\x98So we are going to introduce legislation to ban the glass-and-steel skyscrapers that have contributed so much to global warming. They have no place in our city or on our Earth anymore.\xe2\x80\x99\nThe mayor described it as a ban, though he and his aides acknowledged that developers still would have ways to use lots of glass. They could, for instance, employ heat-retaining panes or compensate by reducing their carbon footprint in other ways. The aides cited as examples of proper \xe2\x80\x98modern\xe2\x80\x99 use of glass walls the East Side\xe2\x80\x99s American Copper Building apartments and the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island.\xe2\x80\x9d Crain\xe2\x80\x99s Will Bredderman\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98AFFORDABLE HOUSING\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 for upwards of $3,000 a month \xe2\x80\x93 could be coming to Staten Island\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Street under a rezoning proposal up for a City Planning Commission vote Monday. If the plan ultimately makes it through the City Council, the high-end apartments would count toward Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s goal of creating 300,000 new affordable flats amid a citywide housing crunch. That would mark a first for a neighborhood rezoning spearheaded by City Hall. Staten Island Borough President Jimmy Oddo pushed for allowing developers to opt to build apartments for households earning as much as $127,000 a year for a family of three.\xe2\x80\x9d The City\xe2\x80\x99s Clifford Michel\nTHE HOME TEAMS, BY HOWARD MEGDAL\nMets 5, Phillies 1: A stellar six innings from Steven Matz, and Jeff McNeil provided his first home run of the season.\nThe day ahead: The Nets face a do-or-die in Philly, down 3-1 in a best-of-7.

The LinkNYC hotspot (or Link, for short) I tested went live just a few hours before I arrived, and there were only a handful of other people on it. I was also standing right in front of it -- speeds will vary depending on your distance, as well as the type of device you\'re using. Still, seeing Speedtest\'s bandwidth meter rocket to 300 Mbps was astonishing. It felt like I was staring at the future of urban internet access in my cold, gloved hand.LinkNYC is the culmination of New York City\'s big push to modernize payphones. Its tall and thin kiosks feature gigabit fiber connections (yes, most are plugged right into fiber lines) delivered via 802.11ac WiFi, USB charging, free voice calls, and a tablet for internet access, maps and directions. They also sport two large screens which display ads (the only way LinkNYC is making money, at the moment), as well as public service announcements. Wireless range clocks in at 150 feet, though as always, that may be affected by obstacles, windows and walls. Each kiosk also offers a private, fully encrypted network accessible by devices that support Hotspot 2.0 (at this point, LinkNYC only supports Apple gear).Signing onto a Link for the first time was surprisingly easy, as far as WiFi onboarding goes. After joining the "LinkNYC Free Wi-Fi" network, you just need to plug in your email address into a landing page to get connected. If you\'ve got a Hotspot 2.0 device, you\'ll automatically get a prompt to install a security key for the the private LinkNYC network. I had no trouble connecting to the kiosk with my MacBook Air while sitting in the Starbucks right in front of it.The process was a bit more complex for my iPhone, since I wanted to test out LinkNYC\'s encrypted offering. After receiving the prompt to install the additional security key, I had to manually approve it and restart my WiFi before my phone phone would hop onto the private network. Unfortunately, while I wanted to test out LinkNYC\'s estimated range this morning, my iPhone ended up dying before I could (likely because I had it exposed to the extreme cold for a while).On my MacBook Air, I saw speeds of around 70 Mbps up and down while sitting just a few feet from the Link. That speed was likely being limited by my laptop\'s connection to AOL\'s VPN, which can\'t be disabled easily. Being indoors definitely slowed things down a bit as well, but that\'s still insane speed for free WiFi. It\'s likely a great deal faster than your home internet connection, unless you\'re paying for an expensive 100 Mbps plan.Even with slower speeds at greater distances, I wouldn\'t be surprised if some New Yorkers end up dumping their home ISP and using Links full-time instead. LinkNYC representatives say they won\'t stop anyone from doing that, though they might have to throttle data hogs who end up ruining the experience for others. Links could also end up being a major gateway to the internet for millions of New Yorkers who can\'t afford service at home.When it comes to security, LinkNYC won\'t be able to detect anything you\'re doing on its private network. On its public network, though, it\'ll be able to track your MAC address. (Update: Representatives tell me LinkNYC won\'t track any web traffic on its public or private network.) The full privacy policy, published by NYC\'s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), notes that Citybridge (the consortium behind LinkNYC) might share anonymized data with third-parties, but not anything personally identifiable.While there are only a handful of kiosks installed at the moment, LinkNYC plans to have 500 up and running by July. They\'ll remain in beta testing until around 200 units are deployed, according to representatives, and by 2020 the group plans to have at least 4,450 kiosks in the wild. It\'s tough to tell if LinkNYC will reach its long-term goals, but the fact that it was able to develop and deploy its kiosks in about a year is impressive.\nIn this article:\nculture,\ngear,\ngigabitWiFi,\ninternet,\nLinkNYC,\nNYC,\nWiFi\nBy Devindra Hardawar\n@devindra\nDevindra has been obsessed with technology for as long as he can remember -- starting with the first time he ever glimpsed an NES.

The feeds are streamed publicly online.\nFootage from one day in March.\n12:30:01 PM\nNext\nWe were able to turn those cameras into a facial recognition-powered tracking system for less than $100 \xe2\x80\x94 using a service available to anyone with an internet connection and a credit card. The process was completely legal.\nWe pixelated the faces shown here, which were captured over one day.\nBack\nNext\nHow easy would it be to figure out who was in the park? We built a database using public photos of people who work in the area and matched this college professor on his way to lunch. All it took was a few days\xe2\x80\x99 work.\n12:51:37 PM\nBack\nNext\nThe cameras are just three among thousands across New York City. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re an adult in America, there\xe2\x80\x99s more than a 50 percent chance that you\xe2\x80\x99re already in a law enforcement facial recognition database, according to researchers at Georgetown.\nSecurity cameras in Lower Manhattan in 2005\n1 camera recorded by the N.Y.C.L.U.\nBack\nNext\nOpinionThe Privacy Project\nWe Built an \xe2\x80\x98Unbelievable\xe2\x80\x99 (but Legal) Facial Recognition Machine\nBy Sahil Chinoy\nMost people pass through some type of public space in their daily routine \xe2\x80\x94 sidewalks, roads, train stations. Thousands walk through Bryant Park every day. But we generally think that a detailed log of our location, and a list of the people we\xe2\x80\x99re with, is private. Facial recognition, applied to the web of cameras that already exists in most cities, is a threat to that privacy.\nTo demonstrate how easy it is to track people without their knowledge, we collected public images of people who worked near Bryant Park (available on their employers\xe2\x80\x99 websites, for the most part) and ran one day of footage through Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s commercial facial recognition service. Our system detected 2,750 faces from a nine-hour period (not necessarily unique people, since a person could be captured in multiple frames). It returned several possible identifications, including one frame matched to a head shot of Richard Madonna, a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry, with an 89 percent similarity score. The total cost: about $60.\nImage fromcaptured video\nImage from SUNY College of Optometry\n89% match\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first reaction was, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my god, that is unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Madonna said, after we reached him and explained the experiment. \xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked at how readily it seems that it picked me up, because, really \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s the side of my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn our exercise, we built a database using only photos from public websites, and we obtained Dr. Madonna\xe2\x80\x99s consent before publishing this story. We\xe2\x80\x99ve deleted the images and data that we collected and are no longer monitoring the Bryant Park cameras.\nOur facial recognition system detected Dr. Richard Madonna walking through Bryant Park.\nDamon Winter/The New York Times\nOver decades, businesses and individuals have installed millions of cameras like the ones we used, inadvertently setting up the infrastructure for mass surveillance. In the past, a human would have to watch the video feed to identify people, making it impossible to comprehensively record everyone\xe2\x80\x99s movements. But the accuracy and speed of modern facial recognition technology means that building a dragnet surveillance system is now feasible.\nThe law has not caught up. In the United States, the use of facial recognition is almost wholly unregulated.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has advanced faster than even I thought that it would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She said that because of how quickly the technology has advanced, she would now support a wholesale ban on government use of facial recognition.\nThe cameras in Bryant Park were installed more than a decade ago so that people could see whether the lawn was open for sunbathing, for example, or check how busy the ice skating rink was in the winter. They are not intended to be a security device, according to the corporation that runs the park.\nThe camera, nestled among plants on the roof of a restaurant, films the park grounds and the eastern walkway.\nDamon Winter/The New York Times\nBut our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people\xe2\x80\x99s daily habits: when they arrive at the office each day, who they get coffee with, whether they left work early. When we identified Dr. Madonna, he was on his way to lunch with a job candidate \xe2\x80\x94 an example of how the midday outings of even law-abiding citizens can sometimes be sensitive information.\nThe police and governments may also have access to a vast network of cameras. Combine that with a comprehensive database of faces \xe2\x80\x94 like a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license database \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to track citizens throughout an entire region in real time. There is no evidence that this is happening on a wide scale in the United States. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not because the technology doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. Last year, companies claimed they could compare live feeds to a database of billions of faces.\nAuthorities have used facial recognition to track down criminal suspects and find missing children. But civil liberties advocates warn about the chilling effect on free speech if the government could monitor everyone\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts \xe2\x80\x94 or, say, identify individuals at a protest. This is not a purely hypothetical concern: During 2016 protests after Freddie Gray died in the custody of Baltimore police, law enforcement used facial recognition on social media images to identify protesters with outstanding warrants.\n"Once the government has the ability to track us and identify us wherever we go, it is impossible to speak and participate in society anonymously," Ms. Lynch said.\nFacial recognition in New York City\nNew York City is nowhere near China, where the government has installed approximately one surveillance camera for every seven citizens. But according to the A.C.L.U., police here have access to more than 9,000 camera feeds in Lower Manhattan alone.\nThe M.T.A. has tried using facial recognition on feeds from license-plate cameras at the city\xe2\x80\x99s entry points to identify drivers through their windshields, although those efforts have been unsuccessful so far, according to The Wall Street Journal. And the Department of Transportation already has hundreds of cameras across New York City used to monitor traffic, feeds that are also streamed publicly online.\nFootage from traffic cameras across New York City.\nN.Y.C. Department of Transportation\nThe traffic cameras are most likely too low-resolution for effective facial recognition. But the city\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC kiosks, which are scattered through the streets and intended to provide free wireless internet, each have two security cameras. Law enforcement agencies need a subpoena or court order to gain access to the footage, and using facial recognition is against the policy of the company that owns the kiosks. However, the existence of more than 3,000 additional cameras has raised concerns about their potential to bolster the city\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance capabilities.\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nTraffic camera\nManhattan\nqueens\nBrooklyn\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nManhattan\nTraffic camera\nBrooklyn\nSources: OpenStreetMap, N.Y.C. Department of Transportation, N.Y.C. Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications\nDetails are sparse, but there is evidence that those capabilities are formidable. The Police Department claims its Domain Awareness System, developed jointly with Microsoft (which also offers facial recognition software), \xe2\x80\x9cutilizes the largest network of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological sensors in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether the Domain Awareness System currently uses facial recognition, though the Police Department experimented with it in 2012, according to Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School. The police have been reluctant to divulge details, and the center has sued the department for more information.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe compare facial images picked up by cameras at crime scenes to mugshots in law enforcement records,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the department, in an emailed statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not engage in mass or random collection of facial records from N.Y.P.D. camera systems, the internet, or social media.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLaw enforcement use of the technology\nAmazon is one of several companies that sell facial recognition services to the public. The company has highlighted positive applications of the service we used, Rekognition, such as its ability to help find lost children. It insists that it requires customers comply with the law and respect others\xe2\x80\x99 rights, but has been criticized for pushing its technology to law enforcement agencies.\nRekognition is already actively used by the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office in Washington County, Ore., including to investigate minor crimes like shoplifting. The Orlando, Fla., Police Department is also using the technology in a pilot program.\nAmazon notes that its service makes predictions, not decisions, and that the confidence level the service provides should be incorporated in a human review process. The company recommends using a threshold of at least 99 percent for applications of its facial recognition service that involve identification or public safety, though critics of the technology say that the scoring is opaque and that the company has no way of enforcing that threshold. None of the matches we obtained from the Bryant Park footage, correct or incorrect, met the threshold.\nMatt Wood, the general manager of artificial intelligence for Amazon Web Services, noted that it is possible that Rekognition, like other types of information available to law enforcement officials, could be used inappropriately. \xe2\x80\x9cThe law enforcement agency will have to be accountable to these individuals and to the law if they violate people\xe2\x80\x99s civil liberties,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He added that the company has not received any reports of misuse by law enforcement.\nIn January, however, the A.C.L.U. sent a letter to Amazon asking it to stop selling facial recognition technology to police and government agencies, saying that the company\xe2\x80\x99s attention to civil liberties has lagged behind that of Google and Microsoft.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRekognition marketing materials read like a user manual for authoritarian surveillance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director for the A.C.L.U. of California, in a statement last year.\nRegulate or ban?\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws that restrict the use of facial recognition. Most states don\xe2\x80\x99t have regulations (exceptions include Illinois and Texas), nor does New York City, though a city councilman proposed legislation last year that would require businesses to disclose their use of the technology. That would apply to our exercise, but would not extend to law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s use of facial recognition.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like a wild, wild west out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lynch, the E.F.F. lawyer, said.\nThe lack of regulation has opened the door to a wide range of applications. In 2007, an Arizona sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office enrolled all of Honduras\xe2\x80\x99s driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses and mugshots into its database, and a Florida sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office runs 8,000 searches each month without requiring its officers to have reasonable suspicion of a crime, according to the Georgetown report.\nThe Georgetown center along with the E.F.F. and others have proposed regulations, including requiring that authorities have reasonable suspicion before conducting a search; prohibiting, except in life-or-death situations, live facial recognition searches using driver\xe2\x80\x99s license databases; and forbidding tracking individuals based on political beliefs, race or religion.\nAmazon itself has called for a legal framework that incorporates human review and transparency. But some say that the technology is so dangerous that no regulation is sufficient.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe future of human flourishing depends upon facial recognition technology being banned,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern, and Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, last year. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise, people won\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be in public without being automatically identified, profiled, and potentially exploited.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFacial recognition is categorically different from other forms of surveillance, Mr. Hartzog said, and uniquely dangerous. Faces are hard to hide and can be observed from far away, unlike a fingerprint. Name and face databases of law-abiding citizens, like driver\xe2\x80\x99s license records, already exist. And for the most part, facial recognition surveillance can be set up using cameras already on the streets.\nIt might be too late for a moratorium or ban, however. Facial recognition is already being used by police departments around the country, Ms. Garvie said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t lock law enforcement agencies into 20th-century technology just because 21st-century technology raises very serious risks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nDr. Madonna, the person we identified, said he understood that tension. He was initially astonished when we reached out to him, but he said that as a doctor, he often talks to students about the ratio of risk to benefit. He saw the tremendous benefits that facial recognition could offer, he said.\nBut the technology is open to abuse, he added, when individuals or governments can use facial recognition to track any group, or just about any ordinary citizen \xe2\x80\x94 even someone walking through Bryant Park.\nDesigned by Jessia Ma.

The five-borough LinkNYC plan will be funded through advertising revenue.\nLinkNYC will install up to 10,000 Links. Thousands of those Links will have free gigabit WiFi, which is more than 100 times faster than average municipal Wi-Fi speeds.\n"LinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will bring the fastest available municipal Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers and visitors," according to a press release from CityBridge and LinkNYC.\nLinkNYC will also offer an encrypted network connection, though the press release adds: "We encourage you to continue to use end-to-end encryption, such as HTTPS, for any sensitive matters or data. The network will also prevent peer-to-peer security threats by eliminating the ability to communicate device to device."\nThe project is the result of a partnership between the NYC Mayor\'s Office of Technology and Innovation, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, and a New York-based group called CityBridge. Mobile tech giant Qualcomm will serve as CityBridge\'s technology advisor. Titan, the outdoor media company that in October\nquietly installed and later removed 500 beacons in pay phone booths throughout the city, will oversee LinkNYC\'s advertising program. Work on the LinkNYC network will begin in 2015. The first Link structures will be operational by the end of 2015.\nSEE ALSO:\nNew York City Tells The Company Secretly Hiding Beacons In Phone Booths To Take Them Out\nMore:\nWiFi\nNew York City\nLinkNYC\nWi-Fi\nPopular\nThe best smartphone maker you\'ve never heard of is announcing a new smartphone in May that\'s expected to have a more advanced display than the iPhone or Galaxy S10\nPopular\nChina shows off its new destroyer during massive display of naval power\nPopular\nI drove a $45,000 Ford Ranger pickup truck to see if it\'s ready to take on the Chevy Colorado and Toyota Tacoma \xe2\x80\x94 here\'s the verdict\nPopular\nTim Cook said Apple\'s fight with the FBI in 2016 was a \'very rigged case,\' and he wishes it went to court\nPopular\nI have 26 credit cards and excellent credit.

Kaveh Waddell\nApr 11, 2016\nJohannes Schmitt-Tegge / dpa / Corbis\nInternet access is getting faster and cheaper by the year. Four out of five households in developed countries now have home Internet connections. But a home connection is still out of reach of many in the United States. People in major American cities pay more for basic broadband speeds than city-dwellers abroad. Fewer than half of Americans who make less than $20,000 a year have broadband access at home, and the number-one reason that Americans give for not having broadband at home is that it\xe2\x80\x99s too expensive.That\xe2\x80\x99s the problem New York City is taking on with LinkNYC, a program launched in February that aims to bring free, fast wireless service to the city\xe2\x80\x99s millions of residents. New York isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first place to offer a free municipal wi-fi network, but LinkNYC is designed to be the fastest and most wide-reaching such project in the country when it expands to cover the whole city in the next 10 years.The system takes advantage of the infrastructure behind New York\xe2\x80\x99s now-outdated pay phones. Touchscreen kiosks are sprouting up where the iconic phones used to be, and will eventually number in the thousands. The kiosks function as public Internet terminals, free Internet phones, and access points for the citywide wi-fi network.\nThe kiosks are being built by a consortium that includes Qualcomm, and an Alphabet-funded company called Intersection. The system\xe2\x80\x99s kiosks actually broadcast two wi-fi networks: an open network that\xe2\x80\x99s just a fast, citywide version of the Internet connection at your local Starbucks, and a \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d network that encrypts all the traffic between devices and the Link kiosk. Both networks require users to input an email address to connect, but for now, only new Apple devices can access the private network.Rolling out an ambitious municipal-wireless project in one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest cities is a chance for New York to establish an important standard for others to follow. But simply getting more New Yorkers online isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.People who who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford broadband access would be most likely to take advantage of a fast, free option for Internet access like LinkNYC. And since low-income communities are already among the most surveilled communities in the country, it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly important that such a service offer robust privacy protections.The LinkNYC privacy policy has already sparked some concerns at the New York office of the American Civil Liberties Union, which the human-rights organization outlined in a letter to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office last month. Mariko Hirose, a senior staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the city requested input from NYCLU on the project, but that group hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet received a response to its March 16 letter.The letter\xe2\x80\x99s main concerns had to do with how LinkNYC gathers and preserves data on the users that connect to its network. The service\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy says that when users access LinkNYC networks, they agree to share information about their devices, browsing and search history, and the ways they interact with the web pages they visit. It also says that the system preserves user data for 12 months after the last time the user logs in.But according to a spokesperson for LinkNYC, detailed browsing information is gathered only on people who are surfing the web on public Link kiosks stationed on city sidewalks. The spokesperson said that the service only gathers two pieces of information on its users: An email address (which is never verified) and a MAC address, a unique string of letters and numbers that identifies Internet-connected devices. That\xe2\x80\x99s far less personal information than traditional Internet service providers and telecom services collect, the spokesperson said.That\xe2\x80\x99s true: Most home broadband providers and mobile-data providers gather and store detailed information about the sites that their users access, and will turn over that information to the government in response to a subpoena or a court order.But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean an email and a MAC address alone wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be of use to law enforcement. If, for example, LinkNYC keeps logs of where and when a particular mobile device connects to different kiosks, that trail could reveal a pretty complete picture of where the device\xe2\x80\x99s owner lives, works, commutes, and visits. The police could request a list of devices connected to a kiosk near a crime scene during a certain time window, and could learn a lot about the nearby devices\xe2\x80\x99 owners from their connection patterns.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too early to know if that could happen, because LinkNYC service is still in its first months of operation. The spokesperson said that the program hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet received any government requests for information, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say what specific information would be available for production in response to a legal request from law enforcement.LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x9cwould require a subpoena or similar lawful request before sharing any data with the NYPD or law enforcement, and we will make every effort to communicate government requests to impacted users,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jen Hensley, the program\xe2\x80\x99s general manager, in a statement.Hirose, the NYCLU staff attorney, said it\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging that LinkNYC doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to collect browsing data on its wi-fi users, but stressed the importance of reflecting that fact in the official privacy policy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are people for whom this will be their way to connect to the Internet,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirose said. The essential nature of Internet access creates an power imbalance that could leave those people vulnerable, so she said she hopes people will push for more protective privacy rules.In rolling out a huge public network, LinkNYC had to attend to a huge range of security and privacy issues. Those challenges are clearly on their minds: The program\xe2\x80\x99s CTO, Colin O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, told The Verge about the network\xe2\x80\x99s security protections, which aim to keep malware out of the system.The encrypted private network, too, is a very important feature that will make browsing safer for the system\xe2\x80\x99s regular users. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s currently only available on newer, higher-end Apple devices leaves the security feature out of reach of those who need it most, but LinkNYC says they\xe2\x80\x99re working to bring it to more devices soon.When its rollout is complete, New York\xe2\x80\x99s municipal wireless system will be a boon to all sorts of users. But since the low-income communities don\xe2\x80\x99t have as much bargaining power as the rest of the city, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the network be designed to keep those vulnerable users as safe as possible. If New York can navigate that successfully, and keep the municipal wi-fi network from becoming another tool for surveillance, then it could provide a model for smaller cities that might not have the resources to start a citywide network project from scratch.

So the company behind the Internet\xc2\xa0service, LinkNYC,\xc2\xa0has now installed a software filter to prevent people\xc2\xa0from accessing adult material\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0each of the 180 Web-enabled kiosks scattered around Manhattan and the Bronx. "It sucks, man. It was great," one homeless man said of the ban (and the porn), according to the New York Post. [The tremendous ambitions behind New York City\'s free WiFi] LinkNYC\'s\xc2\xa0decision effectively creates a curated version of\xc2\xa0the Internet for the kiosk\'s millions of potential users.\xc2\xa0Why is that interesting? Well, as part of\xc2\xa0a closely watched federal court case last week, a panel of judges ruled\xc2\xa0that curated Internet services are exempt from the government\'s rules on net neutrality \xe2\x80\x94 a set of regulations aimed at ensuring that no ISP can block or slow down the websites you want to reach. Those very rules were upheld in a 2-to-1 vote last week at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\xc2\xa0The decision marked a major victory for\xc2\xa0regulators and a defeat for the ISPs that had sued to have\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0rules overturned.\xc2\xa0The broadband companies claimed the regulations were illegal and unconstitutional; the court ultimately disagreed, siding with the government. [Cable and telecom companies just lost a huge court battle on net neutrality] Although the Federal Communications Commission prevailed over the ISPs, it now falls to the agency to implement its regulations. And, partly because of\xc2\xa0the judges\' comments on curated Internet services, this may be a messy process. It raises tough,\xc2\xa0murky\xc2\xa0questions about how the federal\xc2\xa0government should\xc2\xa0think about\xc2\xa0such filtered\xc2\xa0broadband\xc2\xa0services as the FCC\xc2\xa0tries to enforce its rules for an open Internet. You see,\xc2\xa0the government\'s\xc2\xa0ban on carriers blocking or throttling websites\xc2\xa0applies to "broadband Internet access service," but only as defined by the FCC. An ISP whose service\xc2\xa0does not\xc2\xa0fit this definition is exempt from the regulations, meaning it can block content\xc2\xa0without legal repercussions. The problem is, while the FCC took pains to define what was a "broadband Internet access service," or BIAS, it left things a little unclear as to what wasn\'t. Are you still a BIAS provider \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore required\xc2\xa0to obey net neutrality \xe2\x80\x94 if you only offer up a curated Internet experience? Until the court addressed this in its ruling last week, it wasn\'t clear\xc2\xa0where\xc2\xa0services like these\xc2\xa0stood with respect to net neutrality.\xc2\xa0But now, it\xc2\xa0seems\xc2\xa0the answer is\xc2\xa0no. If an Internet provider were to deliberately "exercise editorial discretion \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0for instance, by picking a limited set of websites to carry and offering that service as a curated internet experience," then it would not meet the FCC\'s definition of a\xc2\xa0BIAS, the court said, because the service wouldn\'t be offering\xc2\xa0"substantially all" websites to consumers, just a limited subset of them. So it looks as if\xc2\xa0curated Internet services, at least in the eyes of the law, aren\'t really "Internet providers." And what\'s more, trying\xc2\xa0to regulate these selective curators risks\xc2\xa0violating the Constitution, the court hinted, because the act of curation,\xc2\xa0as with\xc2\xa0newspapers, is protected by the First Amendment. The challenge is establishing who falls into which camp, a task that may\xc2\xa0make life more difficult for regulators as they try to implement their net neutrality regulations. Instead of being able to apply its rules across the board, the FCC now must pause to consider which bucket an ISP falls into before trying to enforce\xc2\xa0the rules\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 or be accused of infringing on free speech. The D.C. Circuit didn\'t create this ambiguous situation; the FCC did when it chose to distinguish between BIAS and non-BIAS providers.\xc2\xa0But the court\'s ruling forces us to think about what\'s essentially a whole other class of ISPs and its\xc2\xa0relationship to what we\'d probably call "regular" Internet providers by comparison. Could this exemption for filtered Internet service be used as a loophole for major Internet providers, such as Verizon and AT&T, to try to evade the rules? FCC officials\xc2\xa0said no, because the rules are written to prevent that kind of chicanery. For one, they still allow the FCC to\xc2\xa0go after misbehaving\xc2\xa0companies that provide the "functional equivalent" of broadband Internet access service, even if it isn\'t strictly BIAS. For another,\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0regulations\xc2\xa0contain\xc2\xa0specific language allowing the FCC to investigate perceived\xc2\xa0cases\xc2\xa0of deliberate rule evasion. Besides, large Internet providers such as Comcast would just be shooting themselves in the foot if they didn\'t allow customers to go everywhere on the Internet, said Matt Wood, policy director for the consumer group Free Press, in an interview with The Washington Post on C-SPAN\'s "The Communicators" series. [New data: Americans are abandoning home Internet] But that doesn\'t minimize the task for regulators. And it still doesn\'t tell us very much about what rules, if any, filtered Internet services must abide by if not net neutrality. Analysts say\xc2\xa0that curated Internet services\xc2\xa0aren\'t\xc2\xa0common, but\xc2\xa0such ISPs\xc2\xa0do serve important groups of customers who feel that the mainstream\xc2\xa0carriers\xc2\xa0aren\'t the right choice for them. Many block violent or sexual Internet content on moral or religious grounds. Fred Campbell, director of the think tank Tech Knowledge, said his research has led him to several providers that fit this description, such as a New York-based ISP that\'s geared toward Jewish customers. The service essentially blocks all content that\'s inconsistent with the Jewish faith, Campbell said on "The Communicators." "If the\xc2\xa0FCC\xc2\xa0were to take action against this\xc2\xa0ISP for their editorial decisions," he said, "they then could say, \'As this is being applied to me, it\'s violating my First Amendment rights.\'" And as the\xc2\xa0example\xc2\xa0of LinkNYC suggests, this thorny conundrum doesn\'t just affect small, minority-focused ISPs. Nobody has yet complained that LinkNYC\'s porn ban is a violation of net neutrality \xe2\x80\x94 and it\'s likely nobody will \xe2\x80\x94 but what if it started filtering other types of content it decided were inappropriate?\xc2\xa0Unlike\xc2\xa0Twitter or Facebook deciding to filter objectionable material, LinkNYC is a company that offers access to the Internet, not a website\xc2\xa0on the\xc2\xa0Internet. And\xc2\xa0that means the\xc2\xa0FCC would need to take seriously consumer complaints stemming from such practices, even if it\'s less than clear that the agency is empowered to do anything about them. If you think this is just an academic exercise, think again: Industry officials who have a stake in the First Amendment claims are arguing this point precisely.\nAs an ISP exercising editorial discretion, at least NYC does not have to worry about #NetNeutrality https://t.co/PHFoWnP42F\xe2\x80\x94 Hank Hultquist (@HankHultquist) June 20, 2016\nComments\nBrian Fung Brian Fung covers business and technology for The Washington Post.

The project involves converting phone booths into Wi-Fi hot spots that offer free 24/7 gigabit Wi-Fi with a 150-foot radius, free calls to anywhere in the U.S., a touchscreen tablet interface, a digital display that shows ads and announcements, as well as ports so you can charge your devices (cable not included).\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC will eventually become a network of as many as 7,500 to 10,000 public kiosks offering fast and free Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NYCLU says CityBridge, the company behind LinkNYC, \xe2\x80\x9cretains vast amount\xc2\xa0of information about users \xe2\x80\x94 often indefinitely \xe2\x80\x94 building a massive database that carries a risk of security breaches and unwarranted NYPD surveillance,\xe2\x80\x9d in a letter sent to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC, which was publicly launched in January, will eventually become a network of as many as 7,500 to 10,000 public kiosks offering fast and free Wi-Fi throughout all five boroughs,\xe2\x80\x9d the NYCLU says in the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sheer volume of information gathered by this powerful network will create a massive database of information that will present attractive opportunities for hackers and for law enforcement surveillance, and will carry an undue risk of abuse, misuse and unauthorized access.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy for the Link hubs says that by accepting the\xc2\xa0terms\xc2\xa0connected\xc2\xa0to the use of its service, CityBridge will be permitted to monitor information about your visits to websites, information used to facilitate use of its services, and pages viewed or searched for, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, and more.\nBut LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s General Manager, Jen Hensley, told Digital Trends that\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC does not collect or store any data on users\xe2\x80\x99 personal web browsing on their own devices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo use its services, you need to sign in with your email address, and after asking for consent, CityBridge will also permit \xe2\x80\x9cselected third parties to provide you with information about goods or services that may interest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes we supplement technical information we collect from you with information collected by third parties,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the privacy policy. \xe2\x80\x9cThird parties may include advertising partners or other providers that help us understand our users. We do not collect information about your precise location. However, we know where we provide WiFi services, so when you use the Services we can determine your general location.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s office responded to NYCLU\xe2\x80\x99s allegations that CityBridge is retaining vast user data.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City and CityBridge have created customer-first privacy protections to ensure our users\xe2\x80\x99 personal information stays that way \xe2\x80\x94 personal,\xe2\x80\x9d Natalie Grybauskas, spokesperson for the Mayor, told Digital Trends. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe our privacy policy is the best way to protect New Yorkers and LinkNYC users while they safely and securely enjoy free superfast Wi-Fi across the five boroughs. We will continue to work to ensure legitimate concerns are addressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC does not collect or store any data on users\xe2\x80\x99 personal web browsing on their own devices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NYCLU\xe2\x80\x99s letter also raised the issue of whether\xc2\xa0the NYPD could be requesting access to user data via the LinkNYC hubs, and whether\xc2\xa0sensors and cameras on the hubs would feed into the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s systems and the Domain Awareness System. The DAS is a surveillance system designed by Microsoft that tracks targets and gets detailed information from them, and connects to 6,000 cameras in New York City.\nBut Grybauskas specifically mentioned that\xc2\xa0cameras and environmental sensors aren\xe2\x80\x99t fed into the Domain Awareness System, and that the NYPD would have to secure a subpoena to acquire this information. The same goes for personal information, as it won\xe2\x80\x99t be shared or sold for third-party use unless it\xe2\x80\x99s ordered by a court or through a subpoena.\nHensley, echoed Grybauskas\xe2\x80\x99 sentiments and said\xc2\xa0CityBridge would need a subpoena \xe2\x80\x9cor similar lawful request\xe2\x80\x9d before sharing any data with the NYPD or law enforcement, and once they have, they would \xe2\x80\x9cmake every effort\xe2\x80\x9d to let users know about those requests.\nHensley also referred to the\xc2\xa0Domain Awareness System, and said that the cameras in the Link hub are \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently inactive and are not designed to feed into any NYPD systems.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NYCLU\xe2\x80\x99s letter reminds us of the\xc2\xa0important point that there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as a free lunch.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 private online activities shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used to create a massive database that\xe2\x80\x99s within the ready grasp of the NYPD,\xe2\x80\x9d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the NYCLU, said in the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cFree public Wi-Fi can be an invaluable resource for this city, but New Yorkers need to know there are too many strings attached.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEditors' Recommendations\nFederal investigation digs into Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s data-sharing deals\nYes, data is the new oil and the fight to reclaim it from tech giants starts now\nIn latest blow to Facebook, 540 million user records exposed by third-party apps\nWhat is Wi-Fi 6?

(LinkNYC / Instagram)\nBy\nBrian Fung\nBrian Fung Reporter focusing on telecommunications, media, and competition\nEmail\nBio\nFollow\nSeptember 15, 2016\nNew York City\'s free Internet kiosks are getting a big downgrade after the company that operates them said users were hogging the on-street machines to watch movies and pornography. The 400 kiosks, which\xc2\xa0have been\xc2\xa0pitched to consumers as a kind of telephone booth of the future, have a built-in tablet that lets passers-by look up directions and make free phone calls. They also offered\xc2\xa0a Web browser\xc2\xa0--\xc2\xa0but not anymore. \xc2\xa0LinkNYC, the company\xc2\xa0behind the access points, said Wednesday that "some users have been monopolizing the Link tablets and using them inappropriately." Because of that problem, LinkNYC\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0cutting off access to the Web browser indefinitely, or at least until it can figure out how to keep users from abusing the kiosks for their "extended, personal use." [The tremendous ambitions behind New York City\'s free WiFi] New Yorkers have complained about homeless people using the tablets to watch porn. Although some\xc2\xa0news outlets are reporting this as a new revelation, we\'ve known about this issue for months. LinkNYC had already tried to do something about it \xe2\x80\x94 and apparently\xc2\xa0failed. Back in June, LinkNYC said it was responding to complaints of user abuse by installing a software filter aimed at blocking all pornography from its\xc2\xa0tablets. The software was sourced\xc2\xa0from a "highly regarded, professional-grade content monitoring system used by thousands of businesses, schools and libraries," LinkNYC said. [New York\'s futuristic pay phones don\'t require any payment at all] Since then, LinkNYC has had months to install the filters. So why, as recently as Sunday,\xc2\xa0was LinkNYC still getting\xc2\xa0reports about the same abuses?\n"There was a crackdown because people were watching porn" isn\'t the story. The story is that LinkNYC\'s efforts to stem the excessive usage didn\'t really work, which may say more about the\xc2\xa0implementation\xc2\xa0of the filter than people\'s interest in online smut.\nA spokesperson for LinkNYC said that no filter is perfect and that it\'s difficult to strike a balance between blocking content that some people might deem innocuous and maximizing the kiosks\' usefulness to members of the public. The spokesperson said\xc2\xa0that LinkNYC faced a bigger problem: People are overturning newspaper boxes and pulling up chairs in front of the kiosks to settle in, keeping\xc2\xa0others from using the devices. The company said\xc2\xa0it is\xc2\xa0weighing policies that might prevent the nuisance, such as time limits and cooldown periods where the kiosk\'s Web browsing feature becomes inactive. While that could deter some from abusing the tablets, it may also make life more difficult for the next people who want to use them. If you build it, they will come. And stay too long.\nComments\nBrian Fung Brian Fung covers business and technology for The Washington Post.

Retailers worry that this could lead to a ban on some of the new technologies they are using and limit their ability to collect data for things such as customer loyalty programs.\nAmazon and other e-commerce companies maintain that rules about privacy and data should be the same for online and physical stores, while some retailers worry that Amazon could just end up buying the data they have at a low price.\nAt the $25 billion Hudson Yards, developer Related Companies says it will hold user data indefinitely.

aS'LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s free WiFi and phone kiosks hit London as LinkUK, in partnership with BT \xe2\x80\x93 TechCrunch\nLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s free WiFi and phone kiosks hit London as LinkUK, in partnership with BT\nIngrid Lunden\n@ingridlunden\n/\n2 years\nLondon\xe2\x80\x99s iconic red phone boxes may be mostly gone from the streets of the city \xe2\x80\x94 and many\xc2\xa0of those that remain are no longer home to phones (one in my hood\xc2\xa0is now a book exchange, another is a dingy mess) \xe2\x80\x94 but the promise of offering communication services\xc2\xa0to people on the go remains.\nToday, UK\xc2\xa0carrier BT announced that it has partnered with Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 Intersection, the Google/Alphabet-backed startup\xc2\xa0behind\xc2\xa0New York\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC free WiFi kiosks, to roll out\xc2\xa0LinkUK, free internet and phone hubs for\xc2\xa0London and the rest of the country.\nAs with its Big Apple counterpart, the plan is to provide people near the kiosks\xc2\xa0with free WiFi (speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per second), along with free voice calls\xc2\xa0and a few\xc2\xa0other services \xe2\x80\x94 which users can get through their own\xc2\xa0WiFi-enabled devices or a tablet on the kiosk.\nPerhaps taking a tip from the NYC service, which found that unsavory types were congregating around the LinkNYC kiosks to browse porn, LinkUK will not provide unrestricted internet access as part of the deal.\nThe partnership will be\xc2\xa0a three-way affair in the UK between Intersection, BT and ad partner Primesight.\nIntersection is providing the kiosk architecture and technology for the service,\xc2\xa0as part of its bigger ambition to take its business model to more markets and evolve it beyond being a pure moon shot.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a global hub for media and technology, London is the ideal city for Intersection to invest in the expansion of connectivity, digital innovation and our business,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Dan Doctoroff, Chairman & CEO at Intersection and Sidewalk Labs, said. \xe2\x80\x9cLinkUK from BT will bring tremendous benefits to Londoners, visitors, local businesses, and international brands and we look forward to working with our partners, BT and Primesight, to transform this great city\xe2\x80\x99s streetscape.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut while\xc2\xa0Google itself has been making inroads into providing high-speed broadband services in the UK (note: some of that, it announced today, will now be paused) , a spokesperson confirmed that it will be BT providing all of the connectivity for LinkUK.\nLastly, the whole service will be underwritten by way of an advertising partnership with Primesight, an independent outdoor advertising network, which will run digital ads on the kiosks. As the kiosk rollout will start slow \xe2\x80\x94 100 in the first phase, 750 in London longer-term \xe2\x80\x94 Primesight has also cut a deal with BT to provide ads on an additional 17,500 older kiosks across the country. These will be in the form of non-digital vinyl display ads, a spokesperson said.\nBT declined to specify the financial terms of the deal except to say that BT, Intersection, and Primesight will all share in the ad revenues from LinkUK.\nLink UK, which is projected to start its rollout in 2017, has yet to get full approval from local authorities, the spokesperson said. But the Mayor of London\xe2\x80\x99s office, as well as\xc2\xa0Camden, the\xc2\xa0first borough in London that will get the kiosks, have\xc2\xa0already enthusiastically endorsed the project. In part, that\xe2\x80\x99s because, with the rise of mobile phones, many existing phone boxes are hardly used for their original purposes anymore. Vandalised and worn out, they\xc2\xa0are more\xc2\xa0reminders of the seedier side of city life than communications hubs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI welcome this exciting new addition to London\xe2\x80\x99s streets. Expanding London\xe2\x80\x99s digital infrastructure is a priority for the Mayor, and LinkUK can play a big part in improving connectivity for Londoners and visitors to our city, while reducing street clutter by upgrading and reducing the number of phone boxes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rajesh Agrawal, London\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Mayor for Business, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to working with BT, Intersection and Primesight to see how we can roll LinkUK across the capital, and to explore its future potential.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor BT, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a useful way of trying to figure out how to shift some of these boxes \xe2\x80\x94 which isn\xe2\x80\x99t as straightforward as you might think to do, since they are considered a public service.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re evolving the phone box to make it relevant in the 21st century by offering people ultrafast Wi-Fi and a range of digital and information services entirely for free. London is one of the greatest cities in the world and it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely fitting that it becomes the first UK city to benefit from the\xc2\xa0Links,\xe2\x80\x9d said\xc2\xa0Gerry McQuade, CEO, BT Wholesale and Ventures.\xc2\xa0But we will be rolling out many more\xc2\xa0Links\xc2\xa0to the other great cities across the UK over the coming months as we look to transform the look and functionality of our public payphones.\xe2\x80\x9d\nToday, there are a lot of existing free WiFi and hotspot services around the London and other urban areas, but bandwidth can be patchy and connections unreliable, and having the added bonus of free calling is\xc2\xa0a useful addition.\nLinkNYC is an encouraging template for the impact that LinkUK might have. The company says that since it launched in January of this year, some\xc2\xa0671,000 people have used WiFi from the kiosks, with some 34 million WiFI sessions and \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of free phone calls\xe2\x80\x9d made every week.\nSince LinkNYC launched in January, New Yorkers and visitors have embraced Link with more than 671,000 Wi-Fi users, 34 million Wi-Fi sessions, and tens of thousands of free phone calls made every week.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCities around the world look to New York for what\xe2\x80\x99s next. We\xe2\x80\x99re proud that LinkNYC has already helped nearly three quarters of a million people get online at super-fast speeds, and that excitement and adoption continues to spread,\xe2\x80\x9d said LinkNYC General Manager Jen Hensley. \xe2\x80\x9cLink\xe2\x80\x99s expansion into London and the UK underscores how cities around the world are looking for ways to modernize their infrastructure to bring connectivity and digital services to their residents without burdening taxpayers. We\xe2\x80\x99re excited to bring our valuable learnings from New York to London and help more people get connected.\xe2\x80\x9d'

Called LinkNYC, it is an ambitious effort to bring wireless Internet access to all of the city\xe2\x80\x99s residents.\nThis is the latest in a longstanding trend in which companies offer ostensibly free Internet-related products and services, such as social network access on Facebook, search and email from Google or the free Wi-Fi now commonly provided in cafes, shopping malls and airports.\nThese free services, however, come at a cost. Use is free on the condition that the companies providing the service can collect, store and analyze users\xe2\x80\x99 valuable personal, locational and behavioral data.\nThis practice carries with it poorly appreciated privacy risks and an opaque exchange of valuable data for very little.\nIs free public Wi-Fi, or any of these other services, really worth it?\nOrigins of LinkNYC\nNew York City began exploring a free public Wi-Fi network back in 2012 to replace its aging public phone system and called for proposals two years later.\nThe winning bid came from CityBridge, a partnership of four companies including advertising firm Titan and designer Control Group.\nTheir proposal involved building a network of 10,000 kiosks (dubbed \xe2\x80\x9clinks\xe2\x80\x9d) throughout the city that would be outfitted with high-speed Wi-Fi routers to provide Internet, free phone calls within the U.S., a cellphone charging station and a touchscreen map.\nRecently, Google created a company called Sidewalk Labs, which snapped up Titan and Control Group and merged them.\nGoogle, a company whose business model is all about collecting our data, thus became a key player in the entity that will provide NYC with free Wi-Fi.\nHow free is \xe2\x80\x98free\xe2\x80\x99?\nLike many free Internet products and services, the LinkNYC will be supported by advertising revenue.\nLinkNYC is expected to generate about US$500 million in advertising revenue for New York City over the next 12 years from the display of digital ads on the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 sides and via people\xe2\x80\x99s cellphones. The model works by providing free access in exchange for users\xe2\x80\x99 personal and behavioral data, which are then used to target ads to them.\nYet LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually use the word \xe2\x80\x9cadvertising,\xe2\x80\x9d preferring instead to vaguely state it \xe2\x80\x9cmay use your information, including Personally Identifiable Information,\xe2\x80\x9d to provide information about goods or services of interest.\nIt also isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear the extent to which the network could be used to track people\xe2\x80\x99s location.\nTitan previously made headlines in 2014 after installing Bluetooth beacons in over 100 pay phone booths, for the purpose of testing the technology, without the city\xe2\x80\x99s permission. Titan was subsequently ordered to remove them.\nBut the beacons are back as part of the LinkNYC contract, though users have to choose to opt in to the location services. The beacons allow targeted ads to be delivered to cellphones as people pass the hotspots, but their use isn\xe2\x80\x99t spelled out in the privacy policy.\nAfter close examination, it becomes evident that far from being free, use of LinkNYC comes with the price of mandatory collection of potentially sensitive personal, locational and behavioral data.\nThis is all standard practice in the terms of use and privacy policies for free Internet-based products and services. Can we really consider this to be a fully informed agreement and transparent exchange when the actual uses of the data, and the privacy and security implications of these uses, are not clear?\nA privacy paradox\nPeople\xe2\x80\x99s widespread use of products and services with these data collection and privacy infringing practices is curiously at odds with what they say they are willing to tolerate in studies.\nSurveys consistently show that people value their privacy. In a recent Pew survey, 93 percent of adults said that being in control of who can get information about them is important, and 90 percent said the same about what information is collected.\nIn experiments, people quote high prices for which they would be willing to sell their data. For instance, in a 2005 study in the U.K., respondents said they would sell one month\xe2\x80\x99s access to their location (via a cellphone) for an average of \xc2\xa327.40 (about US$50 based on the exchange rate at the time or $60 in inflation-adjusted terms). The figure went up even higher when subjects were told third party companies would be interested in using the data.\nIn practice, though, people trade away their personal and behavioral data for very little. This privacy paradox is on full display in the free Wi-Fi example.\nBreaking down the economics of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s business model, recall that an estimated $500 million in total ad revenue will be collected over 12 years. With 10,000 Links, and approximately eight million people in New York City, the monthly revenue per person per link is $0.000043.\nFractions of a cent. This is the indirect valuation that users accept from advertisers in exchange for their personal, locational and behavioral data when using the LinkNYC service. Compare that with the value U.K respondents put on their locational data alone.\nHow to explain this paradoxical situation? In valuing their data in experiments, people are usually given the full context of what information will be collected and how it will be used.\nIn real life, though, a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t read the terms of use or privacy policy. Those that do are not always able to understand what these documents are saying owing partly to the legalese used and partly to the intentionally vague wording of some passages.\nPeople thus end up exchanging their data and their privacy far less than they might in a transparent and open market transaction.\nThe business model of some of the most successful tech companies is built on this opaque exchange between data owner and service provider. The same opaque exchange occurs on social networks like Facebook, online search and online journalism.\nPart of a broader trend\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s ironic that, in this supposed age of abundant information, people are so poorly informed about how their valuable digital assets are being used before they unwittingly sign their rights away.\nTo grasp the consequences of this, think about how much personal data you hand over every time you use one of these \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d services. Consider how upset people have been in recent years due to large-scale data breaches: for instance, the more than 22 million who lost their background check records in the Office of Personnel Management hack.\nNow imagine the size a file of all your personal data in 2020 (including financial data, like purchasing history, or health data) after years of data tracking. How would you feel if it were sold to an unknown foreign corporation? How about if your insurance company got ahold of it and raised your rates? Or if an organized crime outfit stole all of it? This is the path that we are on.\nSome have already made this realization, and a countervailing trend is already under way, one that gives technology users more control over their data and privacy. Mozilla recently updated its Firefox browser to allow users to block ads and trackers. Apple too has avoided an advertising business model, and the personal data harvesting that it necessitates, instead opting to make its money from hardware, app and digital music or video sales.\nDeveloping a way for people to correctly value their data, privacy and information security would be a major additional step forward in developing financially viable, private and secure alternatives.\nWith it might come the possibility of an information age where people can maintain their privacy and retain ownership and control over their digital assets, should they choose to.\nFacebook\nOnline privacy\nPrivacy\nGoogle\nNew York\nData\nData privacy\nWi-Fi\nLocation data\nPrevious post\nAugust 4, 2015\n\xe2\x80\x98Zero-day\xe2\x80\x99 stockpiling puts us all at\xc2\xa0risk\nTweet\nShare\nGet newsletter\nNewsletter\nMost popular on The Conversation\nWhy Easter is called Easter, and other little-known facts about the\xc2\xa0holiday\nIf my measles shot was years ago, am I still protected? 5 questions\xc2\xa0answered\nOur calculator will guess how many healthy years of life you have\xc2\xa0left\nThe new digital divide is between people who opt out of algorithms and people who\xc2\xa0don\xe2\x80\x99t\nCan changing the microbiome reverse lactose intolerance?\nNew cholesterol study may lead you to ask: Pass the eggs, or pass on the\xc2\xa0eggs?\nMapping the US counties where traffic air pollution hurts children the\xc2\xa0most\nWho are Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Christians?\nDoes a year in space make you older or\xc2\xa0younger?\nHow Columbine became a blueprint for school\xc2\xa0shooters\nExpert Database\nFind experts with knowledge in:*\nWant to write?\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 82,900 academics and researchers from 2,816 institutions.\nRegister now\nThe Conversation\nCommunity\nCommunity standards\nRepublishing guidelines\nFriends of The Conversation\nResearch and Expert Database\nAnalytics\nOur feeds\nDonate\nCompany\nWho we are\nOur charter\nOur team\nPartners and funders\nResource for media\nContact us\nWork with us\nEn Espa\xc3\xb1ol\nStay informed and subscribe to our free daily newsletter and get the latest analysis and commentary directly in your inbox.\nEmail address\n\xe2\x9c\x94\nFollow us on social media\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\nCorrections\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010\xe2\x80\x932019, The Conversation US, Inc."

Computerworld pounded the Manhattan pavement to see how citizens are taking to the tech changes around them.\nCurrent Job Listings\nSmart city technology beta projects and pilot programs are gaining ground in New York City. Walk around the Big Apple, as Computerworld did recently, and you encounter everything from free public Wi-Fi to smart park benches and even sophisticated listening devices that can detect gunshots to allow a quick police response.\nMuch of this wide-ranging tech focus goes back to 2014 when Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed the city\'s first Chief Technology Officer. He picked private sector tech veteran Minerva Tantoco for the role.\xc2\xa0During her tenure, she made a practice of pushing for small tech trials that could be modified and adjusted before being expanded.\n"Taking a page from the CTO playbook is the concept of using pilots and prototypes," Tantoco\nsaid in a video interview with Computerworld recorded at City Hall in June of 2016. "The way you do that is create small tests of tech before you take them citywide. That actually has the effect of \'de-risking\' the project on a wide scale," she said. "It\'s a fairly common tech approach, but not so common in government. So this is where some my private sector experience is being brought to the public sector role."\ncourtesy photo\nNew York CTO Miquel Gami\xc3\xb1o Jr.\nTantoco served nearly two years in her city CTO post before departing Aug. 31, 2016 to return to the private sector as senior advisor of Future\\Perfect Ventures, a woman-run tech venture capital firm. On Oct. 25, De Blasio named her replacement, Miguel Gami\xc3\xb1o Jr., a former CIO for both San Francisco and El Paso, Texas, and co-founder of the Council of Global City CIOs.\nAs CTO, Gami\xc3\xb1o works with all city agencies to further New York\'s smart city and internet of things initiatives and has taken the lead on city\'s broadband program, which was previously led by the counsel to the mayor.\nTo find out more about New York\'s smart city prowess, Computerworld strolled the sidewalks of Manhattan over two days. Here\'s what we found.\nFree Wi-Fi on city streets\nOne of the most ambitious tech projects underway in New York, LinkNYC is intended to replace the city\'s 7,500 eyesore pay phones on city sidewalks with permanent Link kiosks. The kiosks, slated to be installed in all five city boroughs over eight years, provide fast, free Wi-Fi, device charging and a tablet computer for accessing city services, maps and directions.\xc2\xa0Free public internet calls are also possible from the units, and there\'s also a red 911 button that can be pushed to call emergency services.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\nNYC Mayor\'s Office\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tried out a LinkNYC Wi-Fi kiosk soon after test units were rolled out.\nA team of city leaders helped shape the project in 2015, which is now under franchise by a consortium called CityBridge that includes telecommunications heavyweight Qualcomm, among others. CityBridge won a 12-year franchise from the city to build the kiosks on the footprint of thousands of former phone booths. The organization is investing more than $200 million to install fiber optic cable for the kiosks, which are funded by revenue from advertising -- large, full-color displays on the sides of the kiosks.\nAmong a number of challenges identified by the New York Times and others,\nsome critics have questioned the privacy of personal data of users of the machines. There is a guarantee to users that any personal identifiable data they enter into the tablet will be encrypted and that user data won\'t be sold to third parties. (LinkNYC does collect some user data to monitor how well the system is working and determine how many people are using it, primarily to be able to sell ads.)\nCity Wi-Fi: Too much of a good thing?\nWhen they launched in January 2016, New York City\'s LinkNYC kiosks offered free web browsing via built-in Android tablets, but browsing was shut down in September "to curb long-term use of the kiosks," according to LinkNYC\'s website. There were reports early on that users were lingering at the kiosks for hours, browsing porn sites or playing loud music, according to the New York Times and other sources.\nAt one point early in 2016, LinkNYC installed porn filtering software and dimmed the volume and brightness of the tablet displays at night to respond to community objections. But by September, amid continued complaints, LinkNYC\nremoved the browsing capability.\nMore than 450 kiosks were installed by Dec. 1, 2016 in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. The project rollout fell behind a midsummer goal of 500 kiosk installations, partly because access was hindered to manholes and other under-street locations for fiber optic cable, according to a LinkNYC spokeswoman.\nHowever, the total goal of more than 7,000 kiosks is still envisioned, and the beta project is moving ahead. LinkNYC says its core mission is to provide free phone calls and free, fast Wi-Fi, adding that a team is investigating adding new features such as a direct portal to a voter registration form.\n[ Video profile:\nSmart Cities - Singapore ]\nCity leaders from around the world are watching how LinkNYC unfolds. That\'s because free public Wi-Fi has a spotty record -- at least in some large cities.\xc2\xa0Barcelona promotes its\xc2\xa0free Wi-Fi at beaches and other gathering spots, but maintaining outdoor equipment and keeping speeds fast enough for users has clearly been a challenge.\xc2\xa0Seattle and Mountain View, Calif., offered free Wi-Fi as early as 2005, then backed off due to high costs or limited wireless capacity.\nSmart park benches\nOne of the more charming uses of smart tech in New York is being tested with several park benches installed in High Bridge Park at 175th and Amsterdam in Manhattan.\xc2\xa0The solar-powered benches, designed by Soofa, a startup with connections to the MIT Media Lab, allow park visitors to charge a smartphone or other device while resting, socializing or sunbathing.\nChanging Environments Inc.\nThe Soofa smart park bench.\nThe smart benches also allow park officials to count Wi-Fi-enabled devices as they pass by, which allows them to estimate foot traffic and in turn determine if more security or trash removal might be needed in an\xc2\xa0area of a park.\nAssuaging citizen concerns, the Soofa pilot incorporates a set of internet of things guidelines created by the city which govern privacy and security concerns for new devices.\nFaster bus rides\nMeanwhile, for frantic commuters, New York is testing smart bus technology to speed up their rides. The Traffic Signal Priority project, along a bus line in busy lower Manhattan, allows buses equipped with GPS to connect into the existing traffic signal control network. When a bus is stopped for a red light, for example, the system can shorten the amount of time the light is red to allow the bus to move ahead, or the system can extend the green time for an approaching bus.\nThe technology, first piloted in 2012, appears to be taking hold. Results from 2016 showed a savings in bus commute time of up to 20%, and as of January 2017, the city has four bus corridors equipped with the prioritization technology, according to a New York City Department of Transportation spokeswoman. An additional three corridors are under study, and six more are being considered for future operations, she adds.\n[ Video profile:\nSmart Cities - Barcelona ]\nThe system also could help reduce the number of single-occupant vehicles on the city\'s congested streets, according to Doug Newcomb, an analyst and president of C3 Group.\xc2\xa0Since New York has more than 5,700 buses operating 2,800 miles of routes used for 2.5 million bus rides every day, a 20% savings over an expanded base of riders could\xc2\xa0make a significant dent in congestion.\nWhat\'s more, in perhaps a decade, many cities like New York could be deploying high-occupancy driverless buses along those same routes, further reducing congestion, Newcomb says.\nIdentifying individual gunshots\nOne of New York\'s more unusual and recent tech projects is designed to help fight crime.\xc2\xa0ShotSpotter relies on sophisticated rooftop listening sensors and software to identify the\xc2\xa0acoustic fingerprint of gunfire. (A 2015 city document, Building a Smart + Equitable City, describes the project on page 18.)\nThree sensors are used to triangulate a gunshot sound and report the location of the gunshot, within 27 yards, to the nearest police precinct in about one minute.\xc2\xa0(For more on how the technology works, see Cool cop tech: 5 new technologies helping police fight crime.)\nAfter a year-long test over 15 square miles in the Bronx and Brooklyn, police found that 73% of the shots detected by ShotSpotter had not been reported by citizens, sometimes, perhaps, because they didn\'t recognize the noise as a gunshot. Police found the initial test effective in helping them respond to crimes faster; the technology has been expanded to 24 square miles, including in upper Manhattan.\nWhat the future holds . . .\nNew York City has many other smart initiatives in the test phase -- including technologies to more efficiently use water, dispose of trash, protect the air and make it easier to find and use city services.\n[ Further reading:\n5 disruptive technologies to track in 2017\n]\nFor now, city officials only laugh when asked whether New York will allow flying, driverless cars over Manhattan skyscrapers. But stay tuned: At the rate at which New York is adopting smart city technology, flying cars might yet be on the docket and in the air.\nRelated:\nEmerging Technology\nMobile\nInternet of Things\nICYMI\nMatt Hamblen is a multi-media journalist covering mobile, networking and smart city tech.

Some of these kiosks were not used to \xe2\x80\x9csave data on their mobile plans, call relatives across the country, and get a much-needed quick charge\xe2\x80\x9d as they were originally intended. Instead, they were used to watch pornography.\nPer an announcement from the LinkNYC team, \xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\xa6 know that some users have been monopolizing the Link tablets and using them inappropriately, preventing others from being able to use them while frustrating the residents and businesses around them.

Evidently, the hubs have also become hotspots for public drinking and drug use \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa0the opposite of the hubs\xe2\x80\x99 original intention to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove the quality of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs New Yorkers ourselves, we want LinkNYC to provide the best possible experience for Link users and the communities around them,\xe2\x80\x9d LinkNYC said. As of Wednesday, that includes, \xe2\x80\x9cremoving web browsing on all Link tablets while we work with the City and community to explore potential solutions, like time limits\xe2\x80\x9d that mitigate some of the problems the hubs\xc2\xa0are experiencing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther tablet features \xe2\x80\x94 free phone calls, maps, device charging, and access to 311 and 911 \xe2\x80\x94 will continue to work as they did before, and nothing is changing about LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s superfast Wi-Fi,\xe2\x80\x9d the team notes.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs planned, we will continue to improve the Link experience and add new features for people to enjoy while they\xe2\x80\x99re on the go.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEditors' Recommendations\nThe best moneymaking apps for Android and iOS\nFacebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp went down worldwide for 2 hours this morning\nHow big screens and small explosions shaped the VFX of Solo: A Star Wars Story\nSonos Beam review\nAdobe gives peek at 7 advertising projects that may make their way to all of us\nDon't Miss\nThe best Chromebooks for 2019\nUp Next\nSony unveils its first 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player, $15K HDR projector\nRelated on DT\nHome Theater\nSonos Beam review\nCars\n21 charged in Chicago carsharing heist; 100+ cars stolen, many still\xe2\x80\xa6\nProduct Review\nIt sounds like a Sonos, but the Beam pulls one trick none of its siblings can\nSonos makes really good surround sound speakers for home theaters, but they\xe2\x80\x99re expensive.

The construction of the network will begin in 2015, and the first structures will become operational by the year\xe2\x80\x99s end.As part of a new plan dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC,\xe2\x80\x9d the city\xe2\x80\x99s aging payphone system will make way for the deployment of 10,000 Wi-Fi hubs, called \xe2\x80\x9cLinks,\xe2\x80\x9d which will be installed across all five boroughs of New York. In addition to being free Wi-Fi hubs that can run up to gigabit speeds seven days a week, \xe2\x80\x9cLinks\xe2\x80\x9d also offer other services, including free phone calls anywhere within the U.S., easy access to 911 and 311 calls, and a free charging station for mobile devices.\nLinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will bring the fastest available municipal Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers, small businesses, and visitors.

aS"Could Public Wifi Like LinkNYC Replace Your Data Plan? | InverseExploreFollowInnovationInternet of ThingsShareSubscribeThe Internet Will Be New York's Biggest Public ParkThe free wifi insurgency will not be stopped.By Jack Crosbie on July 26, 2016Filed Under GoogleNew York City\xe2\x80\x99s remaining pay phones are, much to the chagrin of public urinators, are on their way out. LinkNYC, a New York-based communications company, is steadily replacing those obsolete boxes with public wifi installations. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sidewalk land grab to be sure, but its also the future of the city\xe2\x80\x99s public data infrastructure. Over the next several years, LinkNYC plans to install 7,500 of its kiosks across New York City\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs. The kiosks offer free public wifi, and promise speeds 100 times faster than other public wifi networks and mobile LTE connections. They have two USB ports for charging devices, a tablet interface for browsing the web and making free phone calls, and an emergency 911 button. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been called a magnets for the homeless, drug deal hubs, and, by city officials, a massive success. According to company stats, the LinkNYC network has been used more than five million times since its debut, and 15,000 people use it for the first time every week.Here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable: During those millions of visits, users aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking up that much bandwidth. As of June 20, LinkNYC users have used 53.77 terabytes of data in 6,691,186 sessions. On average, that means that each session uses about eight megabytes of data. To put that in context, browsing Facebook on a mobile device usually takes up about two megabytes of data per minute, so each LinkNYC session only equates to about 4-5 minutes on Facebook. The average wireless customer uses 1.8 gigabytes, (roughly 1,800 megabytes) of data per month, so it would take a lot of trips to a LinkNYC kiosk to equal that amount of browsing. This is what the birth of a utility \xe2\x80\x94 or a new type of public space \xe2\x80\x94 looks like. Nothing happens all at once.LinkNYC is operating nowhere near capacity, but there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to believe that New Yorkers will come around and begin using it as a resource to speed their browsing while avoiding hitting their carriers\xe2\x80\x99 data limits. Still, as the LinkNYC terminals expand to cover more of the city, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that they could expand wifi coverage to a lot of New Yorkers. Office buildings and work sites have wifi networks, so for most people, the only time they rely on data networks is while they\xe2\x80\x99re in public above ground. This is where LinkNYC comes in and why it represents such a critical last link in a chain.But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that easy.Free, fast public wifi might not be as simple as it sounds. The Link terminals are funded by advertising that\xe2\x80\x99s displayed on large LCD screens on their sides, but the company has some powerful backers: LinkNYC is the result of a group of companies called CityBridge, which include Qualcomm, CIVIQ Smartscapes, and Intersection. Intersection is itself a merger between Control Group, a technology and design consultant, and the advertising company Titan (the logo of which you\xe2\x80\x99d see on pay phones), which is in turn owned by a company called Sidewalk Labs. Sidewalk Labs is owned by Alphabet, the umbrella corporation that, for all intents and purposes, ties together everything that we refer to as \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle.\xe2\x80\x9dA man listens to music while charging his phone from a LinkNYC terminal on 8th Avenue and West 14th Street in Manhattan.\xc2\xa0Of course, the web of tech startups leading back to one of Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s kingpins is nothing new: That recent Voice story conveys concerns about the concept of happily linking devices and sharing data with LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s omnipresent installation are ultimately owned by one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful and ubiquitous companies.The inherent privacy concerns are so strong that some digital rights advocates refer to Link terminals as \xe2\x80\x9cspy stations,\xe2\x80\x9d paranoid about their bank of cameras on top and monitoring capabilities. At a panel on Sunday at New York\xe2\x80\x99s HOPE Convention, hackers and privacy advocates discussed the intricacies of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policies.\xe2\x80\x9cFree wifi comes with a cost, and that cost is in terms of security most of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin Dean, a fellow at Columbia University and the founder of Iconoclast Tech said during the panel. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we all know that when you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the customer, you\xe2\x80\x99re the product.\xe2\x80\x9dSponsoredWHAT'S THE GREENEST ROUTE FROM LA TO NYC??Join Shell for The Great Travel Hack, an energy conscious roadtrip across the country.Watch More \xc2\xbbLinkNYC flatly denies that they will sell anybody\xe2\x80\x99s personal information. A spokesperson for the company tells Inverse that it would keep its hands off data from personal devices hooked up to the wifi service:\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC does not collect or store any data on users\xe2\x80\x99 personal web browsing on their own devices,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesperson tells Inverse. \xe2\x80\x9cCityBridge will never sell any user\xe2\x80\x99s personal information or share with third parties for their own use. This includes the city, law enforcement, investors, vendors, partners, and advertisers. Alphabet, Sidewalk Labs, and Google are all third parties to CityBridge.\xe2\x80\x9dIn other words, LinkNYC and CityBridge, despite their financial and ownership ties to Alphabet and its subsidiaries, are considered separate companies, and assert that they won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csell user\xe2\x80\x99s personal information.\xe2\x80\x9dThe company\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy, however, is far more vague. The most accessible privacy policy is linked to on the company\xe2\x80\x99s website, but only relates to the website www.link.nyc. The terminal-specific privacy policy is linked to on the same page and is a far more dense document governing the specific rights and permissions users grant the company when they sign on to a terminal or connect their device to wifi. There are two wifi networks, one of which is public, and one of which is private and has better security and privacy protections. Both are available for anyone to use, but accessing the private network requires a device running iOS 7 or better \xe2\x80\x94 something critics of LinkNYC say will only heighten the technological divide between New York\xe2\x80\x99s social classes. For one, the people most likely to use free wifi services are those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have networks in their home. Lower-income socioeconomic groups, which are predominantly black or latino in New York City, are also subject to far more police surveillance even without camera-equipped terminals.Skepticism of a \xe2\x80\x9ctoo good to be true\xe2\x80\x9d promise of free, blazing-fast public wifi is healthy, but for the average user, hopping on to a LinkNYC terminal probably won\xe2\x80\x99t tie your data to Google\xe2\x80\x99s vast network any more than it already is. Still, being able to accept a reasonable amount of compromised privacy is a privilege enjoyed most by communities who have little to fear from government or law enforcement. Like the subway, cheap hole-in-the-wall restraints, hot dog carts, and \xe2\x80\x9cauthentic\xe2\x80\x9d Oakley sunglasses vendors in Central Park, LinkNYC users do so at their own risk.\nMedia via Jack Crosbie, Young Suk YunRelated StoriesMove Into the Future With the Best Smart Switches, S...Top 6 Amazon Smart Home ProductsIBM Is Fitting Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Biggest Port to Support Auto...Forget the Apple Watch, an Incredible Teen DIY'ed Hi...Bitcoin's Bottom Hasn't Arrived: 5 Reasons the Crypt...Follow inverse on FacebookFollow humans+ on FacebookFollow star wars on FacebookFollow science & chill on FacebookFollow inverse on FlipboardFollow inverse on Apple NewsWatch your brain on blank on FacebookSign up for our newslettersign upAboutTopicsArchiveBrowsePrivacyCommerceTermsDMCACorrectionsNewsletter Contest2019FiltersSort by relevanceSort by recentSort by oldestScienceInnovationEntertainmentCultureMind & BodyBrave New WorldsBrave New WorldsHumans+Humans+Life in SpaceLife in SpacePoint BPoint BReplicantReplicantScience & ChillScience & ChillAboutTopicsArchiveBrowsePrivacyCommerceTermsDMCACorrectionsNewsletter Contest2019"

Terms of use.\nWith LinkNYC\'s blazing-fast Wi-Fi already operational, the public-private consortium today activated the other innovative feature that its sleek boxes provide: a built-in Android tablet.\nThat\'s right, New York City residents and visitors now have free access to Internet-connected tablets at each one of the dozens of LinkNYC stations installed so far. Mayor Bill DeBlasio\xc2\xa0today\xc2\xa0joined other city officials and representatives from the LinkNYC consortium to declare the kiosks fully operational. But earlier this week PCMag got a hands-on preview of the tablets, which are custom-designed for the kiosks\xc2\xa0and powered by Qualcomm processors.\nFor now, the options are fairly simple. You can browse the Internet, access city services, get maps and directions, and make free phone calls to any U.S. number.\nEach of the functions will feel familiar to anyone who\'s used an Android tablet. After tapping on the Internet icon at the bottom of the screen, we browsed to YouTube and started streaming a video, which loaded instantly thanks to the gigabit Wi-Fi\xc2\xa0the kiosks also provide.\nFor city services and maps, LinkNYC provides a link to the 311 web app (New York City\'s information service) and the Google Maps app. They both work the same as they would on your own tablet.\nPhone calls use VOIP and are powered by Vonage in an interface that looks very similar to the Vonage Android app,\xc2\xa0minus your personal address book and Vonage credit for international calling. In addition to using the screen,\xc2\xa0you can type numbers on\xc2\xa0the keypad built into the kiosk.\nA built-in speaker will broadcast the voice of whoever\'s on the other end of the line. It\'s loud enough to be heard over honking taxis and idling delivery truck engines, but that also means anyone walking by will be able to hear both sides of your conversation. A standard 35mm audio jack is provided should you want a little more privacy. There\'s also a one-touch 911 button placed prominently next to the keypad for emergency use.\nFinally, two USB charging ports are also available next to the tablet. We can\'t imagine using them in the winter, but when the weather\'s nice, the combination of power and a tablet to use while you\'re waiting for a charge to revive your dead phone could be handy.\nOne thing we noticed about the screen was that it feels like tapping on a window pane rather than a tablet display. That\'s understandable, since it\'s tested to withstand temperatures as low as -20C, vandalism, and even a vehicle crashing into it, according to a LinkNYC spokesperson.\nThe toughness means that it\'s not quite as responsive as you\'d expect from a tablet. In some instances, it took more than one tap before the tablet recognized our input.\nRelated\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi Hotspots Tested: They Crush Starbucks\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi Hotspots Tested: They Crush Starbucks\nThe tablets take security seriously. After a minute or two of no inputs, the session will automatically end and all data will be erased. Users can also tap an "end session" button when they\'re finished to manually log out.\nThough the current functionality is pretty basic, LinkNYC has big plans for the future. The consortium will roll out more apps and services, including a planned community events calendar, as more stations are installed.\nTo find the one nearest you (hint: all of the currently operational stations are along 3rd Avenue in Manhattan), check the map on LinkNYC\'s website. By July, 510 kiosks will be installed in all five boroughs, with the full 7,500-strong network planned to be finished in four years.\nTop\nRead More\nIndonesia Bans Tumblr, Because Porn\nNews & Analysis\nIndonesia Bans Tumblr, Because Porn\nSkype Brings Group Video Calling to Mobile Phones, Tablets\nNews & Analysis Skype Brings Group Video Calling to Mobile Phones, Tablets\nAbout the Author\nTom Brant\nAs a hardware analyst, Tom tests and reviews laptops, peripherals, and much more at PC Labs in New York City.

Today, the organization is officially launching its payphone replacement hotspots (or Links, for short) --- and with that, it\'s turning on their integrated tablets for the first time. That means you\'ll be able to do a lot more than just tap into blazing fast WiFi from the Links. You can also browse the web, get directions with Google Maps, and make free VoIP calls to anywhere in America. After testing out one of the tablets briefly, I can say one thing for sure: New Yorkers won\'t miss their dirty old payphones at all.\nGallery: LinkNYC tablet hands-on | 10 Photos\n10\n+6\nOn the surface, the Link\'s tablet doesn\'t appear much different than your average Android slate. It features a customized home screen with clearly labeled options: "Internet" opens up a web browser; "Free Calls" launches the dialer; "311" sends you right to NYC\'s services website (it\'s also the number New Yorkers dial for city help); and "Maps" does exactly what you\'d expect (it even uses the standard Google Maps icon).All of the apps worked without issue, and the performance felt like a typical mid-range tablet. That is to say, they\'re functional, but not exactly zippy. Interacting with the touch screen also takes more effort than usual, since the Links use two thick layers of glass to protect its hardware. Still, I can\'t imagine anyone would complain when it\'s free (LinkNYC makes money from ads displayed on screens on both sides of the hotspots).The front of the Links are designed specifically to avoid the accumulation of city grime. It\'s pretty much a flat surface -- there\'s no space for people to rest their food or drinks (thereby avoiding spills). Below the tablet there\'s a big read 911 button, a nostalgically designed dial pad, and two USB ports for charging your phone. (You\'ll have to bring your own charging cables, though.) LinkNYC\'s reps say their designers have experience creating military products, and that\'s evident in the Link\'s tough and utilitarian look. As part of their testing, they even crashed cars into the Links to make sure they wouldn\'t harm pedestrians.Eventually, LinkNYC plans to add even more tablet apps and signage capabilities. Links could make people aware of local events, or give updates on when nearby trains are arriving, for example. Since the tablets are based on Android, it wouldn\'t be too difficult for the organization to add more features (and perhaps even open the door for local developers to feature their apps). More than a dozen Links will be going live today along Third Avenue in Manhattan, and LinkNYC says it plans to have 500 up by July.As for LinkNYC\'s most compelling feature -- gigabit WiFi! -- I noticed that speeds were much slower than my previous test. Instead of around 300 megabits per second upload and download speeds, I saw around 70 Mbps down and 150 Mbps up.

aS'Is New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Public Wi-Fi Actually Connecting the Poor? - Motherboard\nGoogle|by Linda Huber|Sep 14 2016, 11:00amIs New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Public Wi-Fi Actually Connecting the Poor?I spent hours visiting LinkNYC internet kiosks to find out if they were helping bridge the digital divide.SHARETWEETby Linda Huber|Sep 14 2016, 11:00amLink NYC users. Image: Michael HirschSHARETWEETTwo young men sit on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 54th Street, huddled against a tall silver obelisk on a hot summer day. One man is sprawled on the ground in dirty sweatpants, and the other is 20-something, shirtless and examining an iPhone plugged into the kiosk\'s USB port. Around them on the ground is a backpack, a duffel, loose cigarettes, and a roughed-up phone.LinkNYC, New York City\'s newest communications network, includes more than 350 kiosks installed on sidewalks throughout the city and was created to repurpose payphone infrastructure through public kiosks offering free internet, phone calls, and USB charging ports. The project is a collaboration between the city and a consortium of private technology and media companies including Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet (read: Google) company, and represents an important innovation in the "smart city" movement integrating information and communication technologies into all aspects of urban life.I spent nearly four hours of an August afternoon walking down 3rd Avenue\xe2\x80\x94where Links now appear on almost every block\xe2\x80\x94to see what it actually looks like we put our newest and most innovative technology out onto city streets, instead of into our pockets.Read More: What the LinkNYC Project Means for the Average New YorkerMy small sample of Link users that Saturday afternoon suggests these kiosks are indeed mostly used by the city\'s least privileged. Of the 15 people I saw using a Link, only two or three of them would be likely to appear on LinkNYC promotional materials (i.e., one well-dressed woman making a phone call, or one middle aged, casually-dressed tourist waiting for his phone to finish charging). A tourist charges his phone at a LinkNYC hub. Image: Michael HirschMost users were more like the two young men on the street corner\xe2\x80\x94camped out for the long haul, for hours or even days at a time, surrounded by their possessions and browsing music videos on YouTube, making phone calls, and checking Facebook. These campers often make themselves comfortable on makeshift chairs and couches devised from newspaper stands, milk crates, and furniture pulled from alleys and street corners. Miraculously, it seems that these users face relatively little police harassment. The two young men on 54th Street said that they are there nearly every day, but that they usually don\'t have a problem. One of them told me: "They look at me like, \'okay, you on the floor\', but they don\'t usually bother you...It depends on the police."Given that these kiosks have already gained some notoriety for attracting the homeless, this apparent laissez-faire approach surprises me. I can imagine that the city would police these kiosks as part of brand management for this flagship piece of public infrastructure, a "first-of-its-kind communications network".Admittedly, the city has repeatedly emphasized that a central part of the mission of LinkNYC is to help break down the digital divide. According to a 2015 report from the NYC Bureau of Policy and Research, about a quarter of NYC households lack broadband internet at home, and 32 percent of people outside the workforce lack broadband at home.It is worth noting, however, that only 700 of the planned 7,500 Links are to be installed in the Bronx, the borough with the highest percentage of households without broadband. This raises the question of just how central the digital divide is to the mission of LinkNYC, or whether it is just the piece that seems sexiest to emphasize. A LinkNYC user in Manhattan. Image: Michael HirschAnd while the city may generally support the use of Links by those with restricted internet access, it is hard to say whether these home-offices-for-the-homeless are really what LinkNYC\'s designers or financial backers had in mind. In response to questions about this phenomena, LinkNYC recently stated that "We are in conversations with the city about how to ensure that links remain open and accessible for all, and are not monopolized by any individual users."LinkNYC also represents the burgeoning "smart city" trend, meant to create a more efficient and intelligent city. However, a quick review of the companies behind LinkNYC suggests that the focus is less on the futuristic goal of improving citizen\'s daily lives, and more on the well-worn moneymaking practices of collecting user data and providing targeted digital advertising. As Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff stated, "We\'re in this business to make money." Read More: LinkNYC\'s New Free Network Is Blazingly Fast. But At What Cost to Privacy?While it is admirable that ad revenue from the kiosks pays for this public good, increasing digital surveillance and digital advertising doesn\'t seem like the fresh face of the future that one would hope for.Meanwhile, the improvised chairs and office spaces created by NYC\'s street people suggests the emergent, innovative potential of this technology, regardless of the goals of its designers. The users I came across applied their own ingenuity to make the kiosks meet a set of needs not considered or not supported by LinkNYC\'s designers: the need for entertainment, and a space of comfort and connection.To offer poor or homeless people prolonged access to LinkNYC might actually give them access to a resource that the "on the go urban professional" already has in their homes, their offices, and their pockets.

Once completed, there will be up to 10,000 of these structures, known as Links, that will replace all of the city\'s unused phone booths scattered across the five boroughs. \t \t \t \tThe new Wi-Fi hubs represent a push among city officials to elevate New York as a technology and innovation destination, a description that is most often resigned to Silicon Valley in the US and to many other cities abroad, namely London, Singapore and Seoul, where broadband is one-tenth the price it is in New York and twice as fast, according to the Open Technology Institute. And it underscores an effort to narrow the digital divide in New York with free, public high-speed Internet -- a resource that President Barack Obama has called a 21st century necessity.Enlarge ImageTitan\'s Chief Strategy Officer Dave Etherington is helping to drive the LinkNYC project, which will provide high-speed broadband throughout New York.\nPaula Vasan/CNET\nThe project is the result of a $200 million plan approved by city leaders in December 2014, called LinkNYC. A consortium called CityBridge won the bid to remove old payphones and install new Internet infrastructure in their place. The group includes mobile chipmaker Qualcomm, which has helped with connection technology, and outdoor advertiser Titan, which already has the largest contract in the city for maintaining and advertising on city payphones. Comark, which will fabricate the actual kiosks, and strategy firm Control Group are also part of the consortium. The plan with LinkNYC is for the initiative to be not only self-sustaining, but hugely profitable with an anticipated half a billion dollars in ad revenue to New York over the next 12 years -- money that will be used by the city for Internet connectivity-related projects. \t \t \t \tThe first 500 Link structures will be available by summer 2016, with the construction of the first 7,500 Links expected to go on for four years. The contract -- exclusively for providing the Internet service and maintaining the Link structures -- will last for up to 15 years. As planned, it would be the largest and fastest free public Wi-Fi network in the world, providing a cloud of gigabit-speed Wi-Fi access, and it would be the largest deployment of digital displays globally. \t \t \t \t"These really are going to look amazing and they\'re going to change the streetscape of New York," Etherington said while pointing to an early prototype of the new phone installation, which\nlooks like a mini modern skyscraper itself: a thin, sleek, 9.5-foot-tall hub providing unlimited Internet access at up to one gigabit per second, or roughly 100 times the average speed of public Wi-Fi. To put that into perspective for a busy New Yorker, those speeds allow you to download a two-hour high-definition movie in about 30 seconds. Each Link also comes with two USB outlets, letting you charge your phone by 10 percent in less than two minutes (but you have to bring your own cable).What free Internet means for the Big Apple \t \t \t \tEach Link structure will be able to serve just under 500 people with Wi-Fi at any one time, according to Etherington \t \t \t \t"It will start to change people\'s expectations around Wi-Fi if you can pop out for a pint of milk and download the Hobbit trilogy in a minute...it\'s probably going to change your perceptions about what Wi-Fi is all about," he said, before rattling off an alarming stat about Internet usage in the city: a total of 3.5 million people don\'t have access to broadband Internet.\nLinkNYC to bring free, public Wi-Fi to New York (pictures)\n15 Photos\nWhat if you luckily happen to live or work next to these structures? It could theoretically mean free Internet for thousands of New Yorkers who happen to live on the first and second floors of a building near a Link. Small businesses, too, may particularly benefit from free Internet, according to city officials. \t \t \t \tThe potential to lower that 3.5 million figure to zero, in terms of the number of people who lack Internet access, speaks volumes about opportunities in closing the digital divide. \t \t \t \tAccording to the city\'s Center for Economic Opportunity, 45.1 percent of New Yorkers live in households earning less than 150 percent of the poverty line, which, for a family of two adults and two children, is just over $31,000 in New York. "This divide is a big issue in our modern age," said Minerva Tantoco, chief technology officer of New York City -- a native New Yorker who witnessed that divide in various forms throughout her public school upbringing, surrounded by classmates on opposite ends of the city\'s wide socioeconomic spectrum. \t \t \t \tYou need Internet access to participate in the modern economy, because "people who don\'t have it are shut out," she said on a call from outside Bronx High School of Science (her alma mater), where she had just finished serving as a judge for a student hardware competition. \t \t \t \tTantoco, who was appointed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to the newly created chief technology officer position in September 2014 with the mission of making "the most technology-friendly and innovation-driven city in the world," has been a key player in getting LinkNYC off the ground. Her mission in achieving free Internet can be summed up in a single sentence: Create a more equitable playing field through technology for everyone living in and visiting New York.The goal: innovation and social equality \t \t \t \tWith ad revenue funding the entire LinkNYC initiative over the next 12 years, the city hopes that the digital advertising on the structures themselves will help spur innovation and social equity. At the start of the project, there will be six advertisers over four weeks, but after a few months when data on usage is collected, Etherington said companies will eventually be able to conduct smaller, more targeted ad buys for a lower price tag. It\'s a setup that\'s a result of a public-private partnership between the city and private businesses, which Etherington calls a strategy unlike any other municipality\'s trying to offer free public Internet.Advertisers will eventually be able to buy ads on Links, which each have a\n55-inch digital screen, in specific neighborhoods, on specific streets, at specific times, rather than having to advertise on the entire network throughout the five boroughs.\nMore Road Trip 2015\nNew York\'s tech scene: More melting pot, less Silicon Valley\nTake a look at New York\'s quietly vibrant tech scene (pictures)\nFor a moment, Times Square plays art gallery\nThe Midnight Moment in Times Square (pictures)\nCity officials say that the link structures will pay for themselves, not only because they will be self-sustaining from a business sense, but because it will spur a more informed community. "If you don\'t have water or electricity you\'re going to be at a huge disadvantage and it\'s the same with the Internet," Tantoco said. \t \t \t \tOf course these structures aren\'t intended to be a panacea for Wi-Fi in New York. But it\'s certainly a first step...a leap actually...to turn New York into a smarter city. \t \t \t \tWhile millions of people still lack Internet access, particularly in poorer neighborhoods, the people behind LinkNYC say the payphone upgrade represents the city\'s commitment to eradicating the digital divide. The long-term goal, one championed by de Blasio, is for every resident and business to have access to affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband service by 2025. "Stories of kids sitting on library stoops late at night struggling to get homework done with spotty Wi-Fi is an example of what the digital divide can do, and a problem LinkNYC aims to solve," said Etherington.But what about privacy?\nTantoco and her team helped craft the privacy policy associated with the Wi-Fi hotspots, enforcing end-to-end encryption -- which scrambles information so only the sender and intended receiver, and no one in between, can read it -- using technology called "Hotspot 2.0." That also let\'s LinkNYC authenticate users once and allow them to roam from one Link to the next without re-authenticating each time. \t \t \t \tWhat does that mean for you? To join the LinkNYC network you\'ll need to give up your email address and username and create a password. So the network will know a fraction of what your home Internet provider or wireless carrier knows. \t \t \t \t"In\naddition to privacy protections, LinkNYC will also be among the\nmost secure Wi-Fi networks available," said Nicholas Sbordone, a\nspokesman for New York City\'s Department\nof Information Technology and Telecommunications. "It will be one of\nthe first public encrypted networks -- so the act of listening to\nunencrypted wireless traffic will be eliminated." \t \t \t \tTo prevent one device from being able to see any other device, the network will block peer-to-peer communication once a device is on the network. Therefore, a wireless device will only be able to access the Internet as opposed to other users\' devices, which will prevent the spread of viruses from one computer to another and stop a hacker from being able to attack another computer or device on the network, said Sbordone. \t \t \t \t"If you go on a regular free Wi-Fi hotspot today like at the Hong Kong airport, it\'s not encrypted and the data that you send can be reused for other purposes," Tantoco said. "We wanted New York City\'s policy for Wi-Fi to be much stronger than that." \t \t \t \t"I used to work in the financial sector, where security has always been the No. 1 consideration, and I\'m applying that to government," she adds, noting her experience in technology and product management positions at companies like UBS and Merrill Lynch. \t \t \t \tThat level of end-to-end encryption for LinkNYC is a new frontier of free public Wi-Fi. In fact, according to Etherington, LinkNYC will be the only free public Wi-Fi in the world to have and mandate that level of end-to-end encryption throughout the network. \t \t \t \tStill, the familiar objection to public Wi-Fi largely centers on the ability among hackers to defeat security and encryption settings, security experts say. "Expanded Wi-Fi connectivity will have a tremendous benefit, but as we have seen in recent months, such as with the hacking of devices, increased connectivity comes with an increased opportunity for cyberattacks and malicious activity, even if there is end- to-end encryption," said privacy and cybersecurity lawyer Stuart Levi.\nIt\'s an opportunity for New York to leapfrog places like Tokyo and Seoul and become the connectivity heart of the world.\nDavid Etherington, chief strategy officer at Titan\nEtherington acknowledges the validity of these critics. "When it does go wrong it can really go wrong. But we don\'t have that level of information in the first place," Etherington said of LinkNYC\'s encryption policy, which Tantoco said will discourage hackers from hanging around LinkNYC sites in the first place. If you want to use the Wi-Fi from LinkNYC, all you\'ll need is your name and your email address. And once you log in once, you won\'t have to ever again, whether you\'re using LinkNYC Wi-Fi in Manhattan or Staten Island. \t \t \t \tSteve Koonin, founding director of New York University\'s Center for Urban Science and Progress, said the benefits of free public Internet in New York City outweigh the privacy concerns associated with it. "I think those concerns are just becoming a fact of modern life," he said, equating the trade-off of information in exchange for a service to giving up his financial information to his credit card company in exchange for fraud protection alerts.With free Internet, NYC is far from the first \t \t \t \tThe arrival of LinkNYC comes despite a turbulent history of municipal Wi-Fi projects, with cities including New York, Philadelphia and dozens others throughout the US trying -- and failing -- to develop such technology and keep it running. In 2004, for example, San Francisco\'s Mayor Gavin Newsom declared: "We will not stop until every San Franciscan has access to free wireless-internet service." But stopping proved inevitable, as the project turned out to be harder than expected. And now, more than 10 years later, a sliver of Newsom\'s vision is becoming a reality, with Google covering 33 of the city\'s 220 parks with Wi-Fi. Officials say the Wi-Fi speed is lower than gigabit speed, with endpoint-to-endpoint encryption an option only at one location as opposed to being enforced throughout the network. \t \t \t \tIn April 2014, Boston started providing free public Wi-Fi in public spaces, targeting an area that consists largely of low-income families who may not be able to afford the high cost of speedy broadband service. There are now 180 hotspots, often lower than gigabit speed. Similar to San Francisco\'s policy, end-to-end encryption is an option as opposed to being enforced. \t \t \t \tCities from San Francisco and Seattle to Boston and New York have claimed these kinds of projects can help ignite economic activity and innovation, narrowing the digital divide between those who can afford to access the Internet and those who can\'t. But despite the progress in US cities, many of these projects have been curtailed after cities and developers encountered financial, competitive and technical obstacles. \t \t \t \t"It\'s an opportunity for New York to leapfrog places like Tokyo and Seoul and become the connectivity heart of the world," Etherington said of LinkNYC.\nGoogle Play: We\'ve cracked down on bad apps: Google says it rejected at least 55 percent more app submissions in 2018.\nThe best meal kit delivery services: Are you an enthusiastic cook with not enough time?

The construction of the network will begin in 2015, and the first structures will become operational by the year\'s end.\nAs part of a new plan dubbed "LinkNYC," the city\'s aging payphone system will make way for the deployment of 10,000 Wi-Fi hubs, called "Links," which will be installed across all five boroughs of New York. In addition to being free Wi-Fi hubs that can run up to gigabit speeds seven days a week, "Links" also offer other services, including free phone calls anywhere within the U.S., easy access to 911 and 311 calls, and a free charging station for mobile devices.LinkNYC, FlickrLinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will bring the fastest available municipal Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers, small businesses, and visitors.\nThe "Links" Wi-Fi hubs "will be funded through advertising revenues, will be built at no cost to taxpayers, and will generate more than $500 million in revenue for the City over the first 12 years," according to the LinkNYC website.\nThe Link structures will include a touchscreen tablet interface to help people access city services, directions and other features. The physical pillars will also have digital displays for advertising and public service announcements.\nWhile LinkNYC has said that the upcoming service will offer gigabit speeds, the claim has raised some eyebrows as commonly used Wi-Fi networks don\'t yet support sustained gigabit connections from individual devices, The Verge reported.LinkNYC, FlickrThe Link structures will include a touchscreen tablet interface to help people access city services, directions and other services.\nLinkNYC doesn\'t say which Wi-Fi standard will be used in the Links pylons, but it claims that "gigabit Wi-Fi is more than a 100 times faster than the average public Wi-Fi and more than 20 times faster than the average home Internet service in NYC. Downloading a two-hour HD movie can take as little as 30 seconds."\nAccording to LinkNYC, the service will offer an encrypted network connection between the user and a hotspot.\n"We encourage you to continue to use end-to-end encryption, such as HTTPS, for any sensitive matters or data ... The network will also prevent peer-to-peer security threats by eliminating the ability to communicate device to device," LinkNYC said in a statement.\nThe LinkNYC project is the result of a partnership between the Mayor\'s Office of Technology and Innovation, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, and CityBridge, a New York City-based consortium.\nTags\ncellphone\ninfrastructure\ninternet\nlinknyc\nmobile technology\nnew york city\nnycwireless\nsmartphone\ntablet\nThis Built America\nwifi\nRead Full Story\nFrom Our Partners\n20 Years After Doctor Vanishes, Mushroom Pickers Make A Strange Discovery\nWhen This Guy Got An Old Tank On Ebay, He Little Knew A $2 Million Fortune Lay Inside\nTeenage Football Star Makes A Wild Move That Leaves The Entire School Floored\nThe Latest from our PartnersSavings Interest Rates SkyRocket After Fed MeetingWith the Recent Rate Hike, CDs Become Best InvestmentMortgage Rates Remain Low by Historical Standards \xe2\x80\x93 Experts Urge Locki\xe2\x80\xa6Read more fromMortgage rates are on the rise, but rates are still low.

But because the machine didn\'t have a function that reads what\'s on the screen, she couldn\'t get any help."I touched the screen and nothing happened," she told DNAinfo\xc2\xa0New York on Monday. "I plugged in my headphones and there was no speech...nothing that would give me any idea of what to touch or press.""I know that my sighted friends could have figured out where to go and I had no reason to believe the blind community would have been left out," Jacobsen said. "All too often, things are done without keeping the blind in mind. To add speech these days is not a problem."Manhattan resident\xc2\xa0Joyce Carrico and\xc2\xa0Long Island City resident Nihal\xc2\xa0Erkan\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 who are both blind and are also party to the lawsuit \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0tried to use\xc2\xa0kiosks on Eighth Avenue on July 22\xc2\xa0and 25, respectively, and were also\xc2\xa0unable to decipher how the machines worked because of the lack of accommodation, they said.Already, the city is taking heat from residents who say they should have been approached about the machines\' placement, considering\xc2\xa0many of them have become spots for homeless encampments.The lawsuit calls on the city and tech company\xc2\xa0Citybridge to immediately stop the installation of the kiosks and add accessibility\xc2\xa0to those already installed, according to attorney Michelle Caiola of Disability Rights Advocates.A spokeswoman for LinkNYC\xc2\xa0said that even though current kiosks don\'t have some accessibility features, it has been a part of the company\'s plan to incorporate them. But she would not provide a timeline for when those features would be added."We have been working with the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office for People with Disabilities\xc2\xa0since the beginning of the project, incorporating braille, wheelchair accessibility, a tactile keypad, and a rim around the 911 button into the design," said Ruth Fasoldt, LinkNYC\'s community affairs manager. "We are actively collaborating with MOPD on software updates that will incorporate new accessibility features and that will improve ease of use for the blind, including better 911 audio cues, talkback features, and mobile applications, among others, and we will continue to work with the City to make updates to LinkNYC to ensure accessibility for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe pointed to an award the city gave to LinkNYC and Citybridge last year for their "inclusive" product.The company was given\xc2\xa0an\xc2\xa0ADA Sapolin Award in August 2015 because they "have fought for the rights of people with disabilities, and in particular those individuals and organizations who have shown exemplary commitment to inclusion, accessibility and equality," Mayor de Blasio\xc2\xa0said then.A spokeswoman for the city\'s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Maya\xc2\xa0Worman,\xc2\xa0said the agency\xc2\xa0takes accessibility seriously and that its franchise agreement with LinkNYC requires compliance with ADA. She did not explain why the kiosks were permitted to be installed without such accommodations.Jacobsen, who is a 55-year-old technology teacher at the Vision Services for the Blind\xc2\xa0at 23rd Street,\xc2\xa0said it would be helpful to have braille on the keypads and\xc2\xa0braille that clearly marks what things are in addition to a speech option.But Caiola says there is no exception under ADA law for a roll-out period or test period."It\'s just astounding since we just celebrated the 26th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act," Caiola\xc2\xa0said. "The city is often treating the disabled as an afterthought and correct issues once a lawsuit is filed against them.""Once they provide services or a program, it needs to be accessible at that time," she continued. "We believe it would be most cost-effective to have these accessible from the get-go. I can\'t imagine a scenario where they\'d have to go back and fix them and it be a good thing."\nTwitter\nFacebook\nEmail\nMore\nNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island48,000 Students With Disabilities Not Getting Help They Need, DOE AdmitsNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandTerrorist Planned to Continue Killing Spree at Brooklyn Bridge, Feds SayNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island8 Dead in Terrorist Truck Driver\'s Bike Path Rampage, Officials SayNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island$8M School Anti-Bullying Plan Will Make it Easier for Students to TransferNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandVIDEO: Even Bernie Sanders is Fed Up With Waiting for the SubwayNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandCity Set to Repeal \'Racist\' Anti-Dancing Cabaret Law TuesdayNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island$200-an-Hour Tutor Offering Gifted-and-Talented Test Prep for FreeNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island45 MPH Winds Expected to Lash City After Weekend Rain Dumps 3 InchesNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandFancy French Bistro\'s Sex Harassment of Dishwasher Nearly Killed Her: SuitNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandSee How Much Time You\'ve Lost to Subway Delays Since 2012Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandElite High Schools Should Ditch Admission Test to Increase Diversity: StudyNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandMTA to Start Phasing Out MetroCards in 2019, Officials SayNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandNYC Rents Are Still High, But Price Growth Slows to a Crawl, Report FindsNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandPolice Shoot Knife-Wielding Man Who Charged at Them, NYPD SaysNext in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandLIC, Midtown West Among 4 Neighborhoods Pitched by City for Next Amazon HQ\nRecommended\nMill Basin \xc2\xbb\nHere Is the 2017-2018 Calendar for NYC\'s Public Schools\nCentral Harlem \xc2\xbb\nHarlem Neighbors Worry W. 136th St. Homeless Shelter Plan is Back On Track\nWest Harlem \xc2\xbb\nFamed Architect George Ranalli Ditches Chelsea for Harlem\nWashington Heights \xc2\xbb\nMan Killed, Another Critically Hurt During Botched Drug Deal, Sources Say\nDNAinfo is New York\'s leading neighborhood news source.

aS'NYC Continues Its Great Phonebooth Transformation As First Tablets Hit Its Gigabit Wi-Fi Spots \xe2\x80\x93 TechCrunch\nNYC Continues Its Great Phonebooth Transformation As First Tablets Hit Its Gigabit Wi-Fi Spots\nJonathan Shieber\nAnthony Ha\n3 years\nThe plan to turn unused NYC phonebooths into free\xc2\xa0digital\xc2\xa0hubs for local neighborhoods continues as Mayor Bill DeBlasio announced the second phase of the city\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC program \xe2\x80\x94 with the unveiling of new, slightly generic tablets at the city\xe2\x80\x99s newly installed hotspots.\nLinkNYC demonstrated the android-powered tablet for the press yesterday, taking advantage of a \xe2\x80\x9cLink\xe2\x80\x9d structure at a nondescript intersection near New York\xe2\x80\x99s Gramercy neighborhood. The demo was pretty short (and our man on the scene was stuck behind a bunch of taller writers), but it was enough to show that yep, you can make phone calls (through a service provided by Vonage).\nThe tablets look like generic tablets, with a basic, straightforward interface. They\xe2\x80\x99re positioned on the side of the Link structures, so you have to be comfortable making your call from what is essentially the middle of the sidewalk \xe2\x80\x94 you can plug in your own headphones for a little more privacy.\nThe tablets do more than just allow folks to make free calls \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0the city will also be rolling out selected apps, features and services.\nRight now the tablets are installed in the 15 hotspots that are actually live \xe2\x80\x93 all placed along a pretty uninspired stretch of Third Avenue in Manhattan.\nEventually the goal will be to have the 7,500 kiosks bringing gigabit speed, encrypted Wi-Fi \xe2\x80\x94 and free phone calls to anyone in the U.S. (who uses the phone to talk to people anymore?), digital mapping services, apps, and Internet browsing via tablets \xe2\x80\x94 to the five boroughs over the next several years.\nBy July the LinkNYC program will have connected the first 510 installations\xc2\xa0to select areas in Manhattan, the South Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. After four years that number will jump to 4,550 \xe2\x80\x94 with all locations outside of Manhattan getting gigabit speed Internet.\nIn addition to all of the telecommunications features, there\xe2\x80\x99re some features to the LinkNYC kiosks that are \xe2\x80\x94 if not distinctly New York \xe2\x80\x94 inspired by the city surrounding them.\nThe consortium of companies behind the project touts that each kiosk can withstand extreme heat and cold, rain, snow and flooding, earthquakes, vandalism and theft (so, basically the conditions of the city throughout this winter). Niftily, sensors in the devices will also be used to understand how the environment is effecting the structures.\nWe first wrote about the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan when it was announced in 2014\xc2\xa0and though much of the story remains the same, some of the players have changed.\nInterestingly, since the program was announced of the major players that comprises the CityBridge consortium rolling out the project was acquired by the world\xe2\x80\x99s second most valuable company \xe2\x80\x94 Alphabet.\nIntersection, the group that handles design and implementation of the project is the cornerstone of Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s Sidewalk Labs division.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC is just the beginning of what\xe2\x80\x99s possible when media and technology work together to bring digital experiences into physical space,\xe2\x80\x9d said Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s new chief executive Al Kelley in a statement announcing his assumption of the executive role at the company.\nAdditional partners in the\xc2\xa0Citybridge consortium include Qualcomm,\xc2\xa0CIVIQ Smartscapes, and Antenna Design, which created the physical Link kiosk.\nThe move is a big step forward in the development of a citywide free internet service for New York. The only question remaining is how long the tablets remain functional before they\xe2\x80\x99re bricked by people downloading and watching porn.'

Maybe Just a Little\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi may be an almost accidental residential ISP. We talk to project partner Qualcomm.\nBy\nSascha Segan\nFebruary 9, 2016 3:11PM EST\nFebruary 9, 2016\nPCMag reviews products independently, but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. Terms of use.\nCan a smart city free us from the tyranny of the cable companies? When we tested the new LinkNYC hotspots here in New York, their blinding speed and 200-foot range made them start to look not just like hotspots for passing tourists, but like an actual municipal Internet service provider\xe2\x80\x94something that would probably cause Time Warner Cable and Verizon to worry.\n"We actually had a joke of people setting up their living rooms right next to it," said Kiva Allgood, Qualcomm\'s VP of smart cities. The LinkNYCs are part of a broader "smart city" strategy from Qualcomm, which has been working in other cities on gunshot spotters, smart water metering, and even smart trash cans that tell sanitation departments when to pick up the trash.\nThe LinkNYC poles run Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processors, like midrange smartphones, and hook into their own municipal fiber network under the streets. They then pump out Wi-Fi using Qualcomm Vive-powered 802.11ac access points with multi-user MIMO, which helps them get the epic range we saw in our tests.\n"It\'s purpose-built fiber," Allgood said. "The city owns the network. Municipal gigabit fiber under the streets."\nThe hotspots are designed to mesh together, Allgood said, so as you walk between access points you\'ll keep one session ID and won\'t have to log in again. And use will be unlimited: "we do not have any intentions of metering or fettering people on our network," she said. (We\'ll see if they stick to that tune once LinkNYC users discover BitTorrent.)\nSo here\'s where things get...a little mysterious. The city and Qualcomm don\'t want to be seen necessarily as interfering in the businesses of commercial ISPs. But they can\'t deny that they\'re beaming free Wi-Fi into people\'s apartment buildings, all over the city.\n"Our goal is that this is a city service, on the corner, that people could leverage instead of having to go to the library," Allgood said. "That will work for the first two floors of a building but not seven others. Our goal is to give them access. If they can do that from their living room, it\'s just because they happen to be in the right place."\nRelated\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi Hotspots Tested: They Crush Starbucks\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi Hotspots Tested: They Crush Starbucks\nLinkNYC will only get more pervasive, as Qualcomm plans to equip up to 10,000\xc2\xa0of the poles across the city. It\'s also looking into putting public Wi-Fi into New York\'s "big belly" smart trash cans.\nIf LinkNYC succeeds, it could show the way for more cities to combine a citywide municipal Wi-Fi plan with their less visible smart city efficiency initiatives. That means it\'s worth keeping an eye on this project, even if you never set foot in New York.\n"If you think about the growth in cities and where we\'re going, cities and their infrastructure are going to have to adapt and do things differently," Allgood said.\nTop\nRead More\nGoogle Patent Teases Self-Driving Delivery Trucks\nNews & Analysis\nGoogle Patent Teases Self-Driving Delivery Trucks\n1Password for Android Adds Fingerprint-Unlocking Support\nNews & Analysis 1Password for Android Adds Fingerprint-Unlocking Support\nAbout the Author\nSascha Segan\nLead Analyst, Mobile\nTwitter\nEmail\nPCMag.com\'s lead mobile analyst, Sascha Segan, has reviewed hundreds of smartphones, tablets and other gadgets in more than 13 years with PCMag.

At noon on Thursday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio is announcing the public launch of the Wi-Fi hotspots that have replaced old payphones at the northwest corner of 16th Street and 3rd Avenue. Mayor de Blasio will be joined by members from CityBridge, the consortium of companies behind the LinkNYC system.advertisementadvertisementThough the LinkNYC system had a soft launch in January, with the Wi-Fi at four LinkNYC hubs turned on on Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Third Avenue, today\xe2\x80\x99s official rollout includes more hub locations and support for LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s tablet capabilities.Each LinkNYC hub is a 10-foot-tall structure made of aluminum, which connects to a newly laid fiber Internet network in the city. The hubs act as wireless routers that New Yorkers and visitors can connect to for free with their devices to get ultrafast Internet. But each LinkNYC hub also includes a built-in Android tablet, which allows passersby without their own device to browse the web, access city services, contact 311, view maps and directions, and even make free Vonage phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. With the official public launch of the LinkNYC system today, existing LinkNYC hub tablet capabilities will go live for the first time.\nEach LinkNYC hub also features two USB charging ports, so visitors can top up the power on their own devices. The USB ports are designed to be one-way, charging only ports, to prevent them being hacked to pull data from a user\xe2\x80\x99s device. The LinkNYC hubs will also feature a dedicated 911 button that can be pressed in the event of an emergency.The hubs also include two 55-inch HD displays on either side that show advertising to passersby, which is how the free Wi-Fi is funded.When the Wi-Fi capabilities of the first four LinkNYC hubs were switched on in January, their connection speeds lived up to the hype, with many users reporting between 150 Mbps and 300 Mbps download speeds and well over 100 Mbps upload speeds.\nBy July of this year, the city will have rolled out 510 LinkNYC hubs across the five boroughs, and within the next eight years, over 7,500 hubs will be set up across the city.

Each is equipped with USB charging ports, high-speed Wi-Fi access and an Android-powered tablet that anyone can use for free.\nBut over the past few weeks, there\'s been an uptick in reports of people using the kiosks to access porn in public -- and even pleasuring themselves while doing so.\nMany of these people are homeless, according to the New York Post, with Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal becoming especially problematic areas.\nWhile watching porn in public is not a crime, pleasuring yourself in public is an act of public lewdness. Those caught in the act are arrested, according to the New York Police Department.\nRelated: Google wants to beam super-fast Wi-Fi into your home\nLinkNYC says it has put many measures in place to try to prevent this type of activity, but it says it\'s hard to solve the problem completely.\nRuth Fasoldt, Community Affairs Manager for LinkNYC, told CNNMoney the kiosk\'s tablets use a professional-grade content monitoring system similar to what\'s already in place at thousands of businesses, schools and libraries across the country. And even though the system "is constantly being updated and adjusted to block inappropriate content," it can\'t catch everything.\nThe challenges are due to new websites constantly popping up on the internet that can\'t get blocked in real-time. Even general audience platforms such as Tumblr or YouTube can contain materials that some might find stimulating.\nCompanies that provide filtering technology are also reluctant to block certain keywords or limit services to a set number of websites because people have different needs for looking things up.\nFor instance, one user might put in certain keywords to search for a local gay bar, while another might be looking for porn. It\'s difficult for a simple word filtering system to predict intent.\nIn April, LinkNYC activated Google SafeSearch to try to curb abuse, but the move isn\'t fully sufficient. Someone who really wants to see a naked woman could get around the system by searching for terms that raise less flags.\n"The problem is that the internet is very big," said Richard Ford, CTO of Forcepoint, a cybersecurity company which provides web filtering services.\nBut he notes there are ways to learn more about what a user is finding. For example, by looking at the URL of a website, which can include words such as "porn," a system can determine more about its content. And the "gold standard" is looking at the contents itself, such as other links within the page or file names. There\'s also the issue of getting around encrypted websites that can skirt filtering systems.\n"It\'s more invasive and more intensive," Ford said of the possible methods.\nRelated: Inventor of the cell phone says this is the next big thing\nLinkNYC wants to build at least 7,500 free Wi-Fi kiosks in New York City over the next eight years, so this is a problem that will likely grow if left unresolved.\nMaya Worman, a spokeswoman from the New York City Department of IT, told CNNMoney that the city will work with the kiosk operators to "enhance and adjust as needed."\n"While no content filtering system can ever be perfect, [LinkNYC partners are] constantly monitoring and updating LinkNYC to block inappropriate content on the tablets," Worman said. "We are focused on the greater good Link is already providing and will continue to provide as the project matures and expands."\nThe kiosks intend to help people stay connected to high-speed web access and communication tools wherever they are in the city. A group of companies in charge of LinkNYC, including Google (GOOGL)\'s parent company Alphabet, says its tablets are used more than 50,000 times a week, and that making free calls is one of the most popular tasks.\nAdvertising displayed on the sides of the towers help cover the costs of the services.\nCNNMoney (New York)\nFirst published July 30, 2016: 10:34 AM ET\nCNNMoney Sponsors\nSmartAssetPaid Partner\nSavings APY Keeps Climbing - Top Banks Offering 1.86%\nCertificate of Deposit Rates\nCompare the Top 3 Financial Advisors in Your Neighborhood\nIs a Money Market Account or CD Right for You?\nNextAdvisor Paid Partner\nAn Insane Card Offering 0% Interest Until Nearly 2020\nTransferring Your Balance to a 14-Month 0% APR is Ingenious\nThe Top 7 Balance Transfer Credit Cards On The Market Today\nGet $300 Back With This Outrageous New Credit Card\nU.S\nCrime + Justice\nEnergy + Environment\nExtreme Weather\nSpace + Science\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nEurope\nMiddle East\nUK\nPolitics\n45\nCongress\nSupreme Court\n2018\nKey Races\nPrimary Results\nBusiness\nMarkets\nTech\nMedia\nSuccess\nVideo\nOpinion\nPolitical Op-Eds\nSocial Commentary\nHealth\nFood\nFitness\nWellness\nParenting\nVital Signs\nEntertainment\nStars\nScreen\nBinge\nCulture\nMedia\nTech\nInnovate\nGadget\nMission: Ahead\nUpstarts\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nAutos\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nPlay\nStay\nVideos\nSports\nPro Football\nCollege Football\nBasketball\nBaseball\nSoccer\nOlympics\nVideo\nLive TV\nDigital Studios\nCNN Films\nHLNTV\nSchedule\nTV Shows A-Z\nCNNVR\nShop\nCNN Underscored\n-Explore\n-Wellness\n-Gadgets\n-Lifestyle\nCNN Store\nMore...\nPhotos\nLongform\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Inevitably, we\xe2\x80\x99re now finding out that we are giving away more data than we think we are: In a letter sent to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office this week, the New York Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast amount of private information retained by the LinkNYC system and the lack of robust language in the privacy policy protecting users against unwarranted government\xc2\xa0surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NYCLU is mostly concerned with the amount of data that CityBridge, the consortium of companies behind the kiosks, can collect. CityBridge requires users to submit their email addresses and agree to allow the company to collect information on what websites they visit, as well as details about how long they view pages and what links they click. In a statement to Daily Intelligencer, LinkNYC general manageer Jen Hensley said that \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC does not collect or store any data on users\xe2\x80\x99 personal web browsing on their own devices.\xe2\x80\x9d According to DNAinfo, such information is collected only from the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 built-in tablet\xc2\xa0screens.\nThe NYCLU also highlighted the LinkNYC privacy policy, which states that CityBridge will make \xe2\x80\x9creasonable efforts to retain Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us during registration no longer than 12 months after your last login.\xe2\x80\x9d In their letter, the civil-liberties group said that the promise to make \xe2\x80\x9creasonable efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to delete information is inadequate, and also noted that for regular users who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a yearlong gap between log-ins, it amounts to an indefinite retention of\xc2\xa0data.\nThe group also raised concerns about surveillance and sought a clarification about CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s policies regarding the sensors and cameras on the kiosks. From the\xc2\xa0letter:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe policy states that \xe2\x80\x9c[CityBridge] will not give any data collected by environmental sensors or cameras to anyone other than the City or governmental law enforcement ,\xe2\x80\x9d with a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is with \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced, written permission from the City.\xe2\x80\x9d We would like to know whether the environmental sensors and cameras will be routinely feeding into any City or NYPD systems, including the Domain Awareness System; if so, that should be made explicit in the privacy policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter receiving the letter, LinkNYC responded with a\xc2\xa0statement:\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City and CityBridge have created customer-first privacy protections to ensure our users\xe2\x80\x99 personal information stays that way \xe2\x80\x93 personal. We believe our privacy policy is the best way to protect New Yorkers and LinkNYC users while they safely and securely enjoy free superfast Wi-Fi across the five boroughs. We will continue to work to ensure legitimate concerns are addressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn her statement to Daily Intelligencer, Hensley told us the city and CityBridge will never sell users\xe2\x80\x99 personal information. \xe2\x80\x9cCityBridge would require a subpoena or similar lawful request before sharing any data with the NYPD or law enforcement, and we will make every effort to communicate government requests to impacted users,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Hensley adds that the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 cameras are currently inactive and not designed to feed into any NYPD systems. The mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office also emphasized that the kiosks use encryption to protect against hackers, and that any data shared with advertisers and the city will be\xc2\xa0anonymized.\nTags:\nlinknyc\nnyclu\nprivacy\n+Comments\nLeave a Comment\nNew Wi-Fi Kiosks Are Spying on You, Says NYCLU\nMost Viewed Stories\nMueller Exposed Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Biggest Betrayal\nJoe Biden Reportedly Delays Wednesday Campaign Announcement\nHighlights From CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Town Halls With Five 2020 Candidates\nSarah Sanders Lies About Reporter Who Called for Her to Be Fired for Lying\nWatch Amy Klobuchar\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Please Clap\xe2\x80\x99 Moment\nMost Viewed Stories\nMueller Exposed Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Biggest Betrayal\nJoe Biden Reportedly Delays Wednesday Campaign Announcement\nHighlights From CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Town Halls With Five 2020 Candidates\nSarah Sanders Lies About Reporter Who Called for Her to Be Fired for Lying\nWatch Amy Klobuchar\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Please Clap\xe2\x80\x99 Moment\nPromoted links by Taboola\nTHE FEED\n6 mins ago\nOperation Bury Your Boss\xe2\x80\x99s War Crimes\nStabbing a defenseless teenage captive to death.

By July, 500 stations will be in areas around the five boroughs.\nLinkNYC is a step toward an \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive city through technology,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said after testing out a kiosk near Union Square by using a tablet app to contactll the city government\xe2\x80\x99s 311 information service.\nFree Internet can help a child doing homework or an adult on a job search, the mayor said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have fairness, we have to make sure that there is equality of access to the Internet,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said.\nLinkNYC uses an encrypted connection, and CityBridge and city representatives promise security and privacy.

The ads will appear on the kiosks; the network itself will be free of ads.\nThe Wi-Fi hubs have a 150-foot radius for their signals and are 100 times faster than most public hot spots, the mayor said. The city will eventually have the \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest and fastest network in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d de Blasio said\nThe equipment will be visited twice a week for maintenance, Intersection officials said. The kiosks are \xe2\x80\x9crugged\xe2\x80\x9d enough to withstand vandalism, and such actions would also set off vibration detectors, they said.\nBut Goldsmith said that\xe2\x80\x99s not a big worry.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe find that when things are useful ... and they\xe2\x80\x99re designed beautifully, people leave them alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nTo use LinkNYC:If you\xe2\x80\x99re in range of a kiosk, log onto the LinkNYC network, register an e-mail address, accept the terms and conditions and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be online.The system provides super-fast gigabit Wi-Fi.The kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s Android tablet provides apps for web browsing, maps, 311 and domestic phone calls.

New Yorkers can also\xc2\xa0continue to connect their own devices to LinkNYC Wi-Fi hotspots. But browsing on the publicly accessible tablets is being\xc2\xa0restricted after some disturbing reports.\n"A Murray Hill resident was horrified when she witnessed a vagrant masturbating" at one of the kiosks "while walking her dog Sunday morning," the\xc2\xa0New York Post reported Sunday. The\xc2\xa0Post\xc2\xa0report said that "horny homeless men have been plaguing the [LinkNYC stations] since they debuted in January."\nIn July, "LinkNYC responded to the spate of public masturbation by adding a filtering system" to limit\xc2\xa0access to porn, Gothamist reported at the time. Users apparently found ways to evade the filters, and the PIX11 news station said\xc2\xa0this week that reports\xc2\xa0of porn watching and other "lewd acts" have not stopped.\xc2\xa0Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr. expressed concern.\xc2\xa0"After learning about the inappropriate and over-extended usage of LinkNYC kiosks throughout the city, in particular in Manhattan, it is time to make adjustments that will allow all of our city residents to use this service safely and comfortably," Diaz said, according to PIX11.\nLinkNYC is provided by a consortium called CityBridge through a franchise agreement granted by the city. LinkNYC\'s announcement today said that "some users have been monopolizing the Link tablets and using them inappropriately, preventing others from being able to use them while frustrating the residents and businesses around them. The kiosks were never intended for anyone\xe2\x80\x99s extended, personal use and we want to ensure that Links are accessible and a welcome addition to New York City neighborhoods."\nDespite the setback,\xc2\xa0LinkNYC is excited about the program\'s successes. "With 400 Links installed in three boroughs, nearly 475,000 New Yorkers and visitors have signed up to use the fastest broadband publicly available in New York City, and they have used it more than 21 million times," the group said. "We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from New Yorkers who use the Links to save data on their mobile plans, call relatives across the country, and get a much-needed quick charge."\nArs reporter\xc2\xa0Valentina Palladino used one of the kiosks last month and demonstrated the LinkNYC tablet\'s features in\xc2\xa0a hands-on video (link is safe for work).\nreader comments\n168\nwith 71 posters participating\nShare this story\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Reddit\nJon Brodkin\nJon is Ars Technica\'s senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.\nEmail jon.brodkin@arstechnica.com\n//\nTwitter @JBrodkin\nYou must login or create an account to comment.\nChannel Ars Technica\n\xe2\x86\x90 Previous story Next story \xe2\x86\x92\nRelated Stories\nSponsored Stories\nPowered by\nToday on Ars\nStore\nSubscribe\nAbout Us\nRSS Feeds\nView Mobile Site\nContact Us\nStaff\nAdvertise with us\nReprints\nNewsletter Signup\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\nCNMN Collection\nWIRED Media Group\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Cond\xc3\xa9 Nast.

TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images\nLinkNYC has been replacing all of New York\xe2\x80\x99s public payphones with advertising emblazoned wifi kiosks. Residents and visitors curious about what those kiosks will do with data their routers, cameras and Bluetooth beacons collect about them might look on\xc2\xa0its website for some kind of privacy policy. There is one there, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not that one. Columbia professor Benjamin Dean got a big laugh at this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s HOPE XI conference in Manhattan when he pointed out that the privacy policy on LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s website only applies to the website itself, not to the actual network of kiosks. It\xe2\x80\x99s not quite as bad as it sounds. In LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s defense, the page in question points out the difference between the two policies up top, but given the cursory way most people read online, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising if many users initially missed it (I did). Meanwhile, it\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging that Dean and his co-panelist,\xc2\xa0New York Civil Liberties Union attorney Mariko Hirose, actually did read those two privacy policies and that a room full of people showed up to hear\xc2\xa0what they found. Tech privacy policies in general have been constructed primarily to guard companies against liability and discourage users from reading closely. This is unfortunate. They could be standardized and easy to understand. That said, Dean and Hirose\xe2\x80\x99s workshop this weekend\xc2\xa0showed the internet\xe2\x80\x99s power of crowdsourced self-defense. In a way, it countered\xc2\xa0a working paper\xc2\xa0by communications professors Jonathan Obar and Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch which received attention last week for showing that out of a group of 543 college students asked to check out a new website, only 11 noticed that when they signed up they agreed\xc2\xa0to terms that gave its operators rights to the users\xe2\x80\x99 first born children.\nCoverage of the paper focused on the fact that so few users even looked at the papers, but what surprised me was that anyone looked at all. In other words, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Dean or a Hirose in any group.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the answer is to find a way to have everyone read every privacy policy. This, as I note in the paper above, is an \xe2\x80\x98unattainable ideal.'\xe2\x80\x9d Obar wrote the Observer in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cSo efforts to standardize language, even simplify language, even in accordance with American law aimed at making policies easier to understand, continue to fail.\xe2\x80\x9dTo a degree, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if everyone checks everything. Terms of service apply to lots of people at once. If one person looks at them and sees something disturbing, he or she can put out the word. If it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough the internet will respond.\nA LinkNYC wifi kiosk going in. Edward Blake / Flickr\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s powerful about this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s workshop: Dean and Hirose told a roomful of people what they found. Those people chattered about it on Twitter and then a reporter at Inverse wrote a detailed story breaking what they had to say\xc2\xa0down.LinkNYC, by the way, is a product of Intersection, which is owned by Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Alphabet (the company formerly known as Google). Google likes to link data about your behavior to\xc2\xa0your location. Your phone\xe2\x80\x99s wi-fi antenna constantly broadcasts a map of your favorite places, as artists dramatized with a multimedia installation next year. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising if LinkNYC kiosks started recording which wifi access points the phones passing it are looking for.As Hirose pointed out in the talk, just because LinkNYC kiosks don\xe2\x80\x99t use a sensor now doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cThey essentially have a privacy policy that says, \xe2\x80\x98we can collect anything and do anything\xe2\x80\x99 and that sets the outer bound,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\xc2\xa0The policy does forbid the company from some activities. For example, it promises not to use facial recognition, which has become dramatically more powerful; however, nothing stops the company from retracting that guarantee. In fact, Hirose said that she\xe2\x80\x99s been told by the company that the kiosk\xe2\x80\x99s cameras haven\xe2\x80\x99t even been turned on yet, but it is also under no obligation to tell the public when the cameras go live.And when users notice an objectionable change in policy: what can they\xc2\xa0do from there? If a website really did try to reserve rights to all members\xe2\x80\x99 first born child, the outcry\xc2\xa0of the internet would likely be enough to get the policy retracted (though the provision could also attract a niche audience for a company, but only if it\xc2\xa0promised). The trouble is, here in America, that\xe2\x80\x99s really all we have to defend ourselves with: outrage. If it\xe2\x80\x99s deafening, it can be enough, but if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to more than a slow rumble, tech companies will shrug it off with a bit of spin.\nMayor Bill de Blaisio, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got mail. Michael Appleton for the Mayoral Photography Office\nFor example, the NYCLU sent a letter to the city in March pushing for stronger language around data volume, retention, government use and sharing, but the city\xe2\x80\x94which has secured a substantial promised payday from Sidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x94has ignored it. There\xe2\x80\x99s little more attorneys can do under current law. We have this outmoded idea called the \xe2\x80\x9cthird party doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d that once someone uses a company\xe2\x80\x99s service, they give up all rights to privacy over whatever data that use generates.For example, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like Facebook, but I keep it active because I want to get the invite if someone wants me to come to a party. Yet the fact that I want to get invitations leaves everything else I might have done on the site over the last 10 years up for grabs by the government and Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s commercial partners. Of course, I could quit the site, but walking away from those invitations would impose a very high cost. Most people are\xc2\xa0unwilling to pay the price of giving up such networks, which allows their owners to gradually ratchet up the rights they grant themselves under terms of service that we can\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate unless we do it en masse.It\xe2\x80\x99s not that way everywhere. Last week, French authorities\xc2\xa0called out Microsoft for releasing the Windows 10 operating system, which turns personal computers into the sort of tattletales that smartphones have been all along. It\xe2\x80\x99s one more way in which all Americans envy the French.\xe2\x80\x9cData privacy self-management is a fallacy under the current model,\xe2\x80\x9d Obar wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cMore needs to be done to involve users (automated systems, infomediaries\xe2\x80\xa6) and ensure that the mosaic of Big Data approaches and threats can be properly monitored.\xe2\x80\x9dBig tech companies find new ways to watch us every day. It\xe2\x80\x99s reassuring, at least, to know that there are a few people out there watching back.UPDATE: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Benjamin Dean as Benjamin Read.

It\'s in the early stages of an ambitious project to blanket the city with ultrafast Wi-Fi via smart kiosks, which will replace obsolete public telephones.These kiosks are the work of a Google-backed startup called Intersection. The company has already installed around 1,000 kiosks, and aims to install more than 6,000 more, Intersection Chief Innovation Officer Colin O\'Donnell said in an interview this week. Mike Elgan\nIntersection Chief Innovation Officer Colin O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell on stage at Cannes Lions on June 18, 2017.\nEach kiosk is around nine feet high and relatively flat. Each flat side houses a big-screen display that pays for the whole operation with advertising. The screens also show emergency and other public information.A smaller user terminal on the skinny edge facing away from the street allows one user at a time to access information and make calls. The screen is a locked-down Android tablet with a custom interface offering a few apps to access various services, including one for paying parking tickets and another for voter registration. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld\'s Facebook page. ]Below the screen on the left is a big, red button for a one-press 911 emergency call. Under that is an audio jack, where non-iPhone users can insert their headphones or earbuds for privacy. (The hardware supports standard audio jacks, but not Apple\'s newer lightning cable configuration.) Next to those options is a numeric keypad for dialing calls. And below all that are two USB ports for charging devices.[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ] Each kiosk provides free, high-speed Wi-Fi for anyone in range. By selecting the Wi-Fi network at one kiosk, and authenticating with an email address, each user will be automatically connected to every other LinkNYC kiosk they get within range of. Eventually, anyone will be able to walk around most of the city without losing the connection to these hotspots. Wide-angle cameras on each side of the kiosks point up and down the street and sidewalk, approximating a 360-degree view. The company claims it deletes stored videos after 7 days, unless there\'s a compelling reason to keep them, according to O\'Donnell.While the built-in kiosk tablet doesn\'t appear to offer a high-performance user experience, the public Wi-Fi is blistering fast -- far faster than the average connection speeds offered by mobile carriers over cell networks. Some New York content creators producing massive amounts of content, such as HD videos, are now hauling their laptops down to the street for faster uploading. CityBridge\nIntersection has already installed 1,000 LinkNYC smart kiosks on New York sidewalks. It\'s planning more than 6,000 more.\nThis is possible because LinkNYC kiosks are connected by fiber.It\'s paid for by the advertising and costs nothing to taxpayers. In fact, the city is expected to earn $500 million over the 10-year Intersection contract. London is the second Intersection city, where the project is called InLinkUK and the kiosks are called "InLinks." The London project is more modest, with a goal of around 1,000 kiosks. O\'Donnell told me Intersection plans to deploy in 20 more cities after that.Intersection is tightly conjoined with Alphabet\'s Sidewalk Labs company, which works to accelerate and guide the creation of smart cities. They even share an office in Manhattan. Other partners in the LinkNYC project include Qualcomm and\xc2\xa0Civiq Smartscapes (BT is a partner for the London project).Smart cities: the immediate impactLinkNYC is already changing New York; two million people are now using the system -- twice as many as in January.The existence of smart-city implementations like Intersection\'s LinkNYC means that New Yorkers won\'t actually need mobile contracts anymore. Most who would otherwise pay for them will no doubt continue to do so for the convenience. But those who could not afford a phone contract in the past will have ubiquitous fast connectivity in the future.This strongly erodes the digital divide within smart cities. A 2015 study conducted by New York City found that more than a quarter of city households had no internet connectivity at home, and more than half a million people didn\'t own their own computer.At the same time, smart city kiosks widen the gap between urban and rural people, where the urban take a big leap forward and the rural stay behind with no solution in sight.Smart cities are built on citywide fiber networks, which can eventually (as with the case of ZenFi\'s network) connect 5G wireless antennas on every street corner and every floor of every office building back to the core network. This densification of the wireless networks is the true hero of the smart cities revolution, enabling not only smart-city kiosks, but capacity for high-speed wireless applications on smartphones and tablets, widespread IoT deployments, mobile augmented reality applications, self-driving cars and more.It\'s also amazing that New York is leading the smart city charge. Because if the concept can make it there, it can make it anywhere. Dark-fiber deployments in New York typically cost far more than in just about any other city because of heavy unionization and the scale of any disruption when streets have to be closed for fiber installation.New York\'s example in aggressively enabling thousands of high-speed kiosks also puts pressure on other U.S. cities to follow suit. The first step is not only to wire up entire cities with fast fiber, but to architect it in a way that enables flexible deployment, as ZenFi is doing. And this is the best part of the smart cities revolution.Smart cities: the long-term impactO\'Donnell claims that smart city rollouts happen in three phases, which he says is about "building the city from the internet up."1. Instrumentation 2. Intelligence 3. Responsiveness.New York is currently at the beginning of the instrumentation phase, where the immediate benefits are to underserved and under-connected members of the public. Over the next 15 years, the city will go through the other two phases, where sensor data will be processed by artificial intelligence (A.I.) to gain unprecedented insights about traffic, environment and human behavior and eventually use it to intelligently re-direct traffic and shape other city functions.The two most transformational technologies will be augmented reality (AR) and autonomous cars. AR won\'t be one specific set of technologies, but many variations that will range from low-bandwidth and even offline applications to ultra HD streaming AR.New York\'s LinkNYC kiosks mean everyone in the city will have network support for high-end streaming AR as they move around the city. Enterprises operating in the city can deploy top-of-the-line equipment and applications and rely on 5G connectivity on every block.And as autonomous cars gradually roll out, New York will be well positioned to be one of the first cities to legalize them, because they\'ll be safer thanks to 5G, sensors and data from all those kiosks. This will enable a revolution in delivery systems, among other things.(Note: The use of LinkNYC kiosks in the future for AR and self-driving cars is my own\xc2\xa0expectation; it\'s not based on current plans by Intersection.)\xc2\xa0Risks and rewardsSmart kiosks do carry risks, however. One involves privacy. O\'Donnell said privacy policies aren\'t set by Intersection, but are negotiated agreements between the company and the city. So if a city wants to use those cameras and sensors for surveillance, it can.But the biggest risk revolves around hacking and the theft of data, monitoring of cameras and -- a worst-case scenario -- eventual control of the "Responsiveness" phase technology, where mayhem is deliberately caused.Futurists and tech pundits often assume that if a beneficial set of technologies exists, it will be implemented and widely distributed. But this is obviously not true. Technology revolutions require drivers to realize them.In this case, New York City and Intersection are the drivers, showing the enormous benefits of ubiquitous high-speed wireless, as well as connected sensor stations all over a city. This will drive huge demand in other cities to replicate the technology, which will create demand for city-wide flexible dark-fiber installation, which will transform how enterprises operate.For enterprises, the advances change assumptions about what\'s possible for how offices, warehouses, field service, delivery and, eventually, next-generation technologies will work.The most important calculation is the question of where: Where should offices, warehouses, factories and other major locations be built? Answer: They\'ll gravitate to smart cities. Because the benefits to enterprises of ubiquitous and dense high-speed wireless, sensor-based city services and fiber everywhere will prove incalculable.\nRelated:\nMobile\nWi-Fi\nMobile Apps\nGoogle\nMike Elgan is a technology-obsessed journalist, author, blogger, podcaster and digital nomad.

More than 400 InLink units are now live across the UK.With two ultra-modern InLink units initially introduced into Aberdeen city centre, at Upperkirkgate and Palmerston Road, a further eight activations are expected in the coming weeks, including Union Street and George Street. The new state of the art InLinks are replacing 23 existing payphones, offering more space on pavements, as on average, one unit replaces two BT payphones. BT\xe2\x80\x99s iconic red phone boxes will remain.Jenny Laing, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAberdeen continues to build its reputation as a destination for business and tourism. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to see another development for local people, visitors and businesses which supports our digital ambitions.\xe2\x80\x9cSupporting our city centre with fast wi-fi and other services will help increase footfall, and aid retail and economic growth as a result.\xe2\x80\x9dAlso welcoming the investment, Innes Walker, city centre manager for Aberdeen Inspired, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe addition of InLink devices to the city centre will help visitors recognise Aberdeen as a modern, forward-looking, technologically advanced city, supporting the tourist and retail economy and helping to attract investment. It is a great enhancement and one that Aberdeen inspired, along with Aberdeen City Council, have worked closely with BT on. By providing facilities for people to make free calls, access free wi-fi and charge their phones, the InLink service will add much to our city.\xe2\x80\x9dThe InLink service from BT, which is funded by advertising revenue to deliver free services at no cost to the taxpayer and local councils, already has more than 319,000 subscribers across the UK. Additional unique InLink features include encrypted WiFi, which protects your personal information when connected on compatible devices, interactive maps which allow users to easily get from one location to another, an emergency 999 call button and the option to add air quality monitors to allow local governments to build sustainable clean-air strategies.David Wallace, BT Director for public sector in Scotland and chair of the BT Scotland board, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAt BT, inclusive services are really important to us and we want everyone to be able to make the most of digital opportunities. The new InLink service from BT will benefit all of those who live, work and visit Aberdeen.\xe2\x80\x9cWe welcome the support from Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeen Inspired in helping us deliver this new service. Across the UK, InLink is already transforming high streets, removing unwanted payphones and giving streets a modern facelift with our compact and free of charge wi-fi and digital services.\xe2\x80\x9dProviding ultrafast wi-fi speeds of up to one gigabit per second (1Gbps), the fastest free public wi-fi service available in the UK, each InLink also provides more than 1,000 hours of local messaging a year, acting as a community notice board for the local area. These services are provided to the community at no public cost, as the project is funded by advertising revenue.Matt Bird, General Manager of InLinkUK, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are keen to continue our very successful roll out of the InLink from BT service to benefit consumers in Aberdeen. We want to support consumers\xe2\x80\x99 digital innovation ambitions by offering city workers, shoppers and tourists free digital services and help to create a Smart city in Aberdeen.\xe2\x80\x9dThe InLinkUK from BT service is dedicated to providing all-inclusive digital services, one of which is their charity icon on the tablet. A free one-touch lifeline to four national charities, which provides free calls to Childline, End Youth Homelessness, Runaway Helpline and Samaritans. The InLinks are also designed for wheelchair access and offer additional digital services, including for those who have sight and visual impairments.InLinkUK from BT is a partnership between BT and tech start up InLinkUK.NotesAbout InLinkUKInLinkUK is a tech start up providing a new communications network that will replace over 1,000 pay phones in major cities across the UK, with new units called InLinks.

The hub will also include a wireless hotspot for connecting smartphones, tablets and PCs to the Internet.But the new technology has one potential challenge that pay phones didn't have: How do you keep the hubs -- also called Links -- up to date in a fast-changing technology world?[ Further reading: The best CPUs for gaming ]The project will handle that problem by bringing major technology upgrades to Links, at least during the first six years, a spokesman for the LinkNYC project said Monday. The city is still testing the Links and figuring out an upgrade schedule.The upgrades will focus in part on increasing processing power and wireless speeds.\xc2\xa0Sitting at the center of Links is an Android tablet on which a user can surf the Internet, use pre-installed apps, or make phone calls. On each side of the Link are 55 high-definition displays for advertisements and city notices.Qualcomm has provided some of the technologies for the Links, which are designed so the networking equipment, processor, tablet and other components can be regularly swapped out and upgraded.Qualcomm is committed to maintaining and upgrading systems over\xc2\xa0the lifetime of Links, said Kiva Allgood, vice president at Qualcomm's Smart Cities and Industrial IoT initiative. The goal is to keep the Links up to date with the latest technologies much like latest smartphones, Allgood said.The Links and the Android tablets are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor with an Adreno 320 GPU. It'll be easy to snap out old technologies and plug in the latest processor and tablet, or change the screen to a higher resolution display, project organizers said.The Links' Wi-Fi and modem technologies will also be upgradable. A Link has 802.11ac multi-mode MIMO chip for gigabit Wi-Fi. It also has a 3G modem for 911 emergency calling and location services.\xc2\xa0Qualcomm designs modems and Wi-Fi chipsets, which are used in other companies' products like smartphones and routers. The company didn't say whether upgrades would be made by the company or by partners. LinkNYC is in beta, and product plans will be released to partners over time,\xc2\xa0Allgood said.Systems like LinkNYC need hardware flexibility to keep up with new Internet of Things implementations, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.The way New York City uses the LinkNYC systems could change over time, and they may be the backbone to connect lighting systems, smart meters, traffic networks, connected cameras and other IoT systems, McGregor said.Hardware changes like memory and modem upgrades will be needed over time, McGregor said. An example could be an upgrade to 5G connectivity, a technology designed to facilitate IoT and machine-to-machine communication.But upgrades will need to be relevant, not random. For example, a processor upgrade would make sense if it's used to handle faster modems and high-resolution screens, McGregor said.\nTo comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\nHardware\nCPUs\nShop Tech Products at Amazon\nPCWorld\nPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nDigital Magazine\nGift Subscription\nAd Choices\nMember Preferences\nCookie Policy\nNewsletters\nTerms of Service Agreement\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\nShop\nCoupon Codes\nAliexpress\nEbay\nHome Depot\nHP\njcpenney\nOnePlus\nWalmart\nTarget\n6PM\nE-commerce Affiliate Relationships\nPCWorld Categories\nBusiness\nLaptops\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nDeals\nPrinters\nSecurity\nSoftware\nVideos\nWindows\nIDG Network Sites\nAdvertise\nPermissions\nMacworld\nTech Advisor\nTechHive\nIDG TechNetwork\nIDG\nIDG Blog\nCareers at IDG\nGet PCWorld's Digital Editions\nSubscribe Now\nFollow us\n\xef\x98\x90\n\xef\x98\x91\n\xef\x98\xb0\nVisit other IDG sites:\nSelect One\nGameStar\nGreenbot\nMacworld\nPCWorld\nTechHive\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019 IDG Communications, Inc."

Created by City of New York and CityBridge, a NYC\xe2\x80\x93based consortium of leading experts in technology, media, connectivity and user experience, these high-tech replacements for pay phones have already appeared on hundreds of street corners in Manhattan and the Bronx. Eventually 7,500 of the kiosks, nine-and-a-half feet tall curbed monoliths which offer free access to maps and city services, voice calls, device charging, and internet browsing, will cover the five boroughs, providing $500 million in ad revenue to the city over the next 12 years (the ad-supported network is being installed at no cost the the city)\nWill these new hubs live up to their promise of delivering tech equity by providing free high-speed internet access and helping bridge the digital divide, or are they just another invasive smart screen cluttering our landscape, a "personalized propaganda engine?" Curbed spoke with Dave Etherington, Chief of Strategy for Intersection, about the introduction of these high-tech kiosks and how to balance usefulness and ubiquity when designing a new advertising medium.\nWhat have you learned about how these kiosks are operating on the streets?\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s exceeded our expectation around usage. We\xe2\x80\x99re pretty early on, only about 5 percent of the Link kiosks have been installed. That\xe2\x80\x99s 330 in Manhattan and the Bronx, then Queens this week, and construction has been started in both Brooklyn and Staten Island. With those 330, adoption has been great. We already have 250,000 registered users. Every week the number changes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying 15,000 new registers a week, and this week, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say it was over 20,000 new users. So we\'re well on the way to 1 million unique users. Last week, we had 1,000,000 wi-fi sessions and 40,000 tablet sessions, around half being phone calls. It\xe2\x80\x99s been stunning the amount of use we\xe2\x80\x99re getting. And there are plenty of surprising things; people have been playing YouTube videos and having impromptu dance parties in the street."\nYou mentioned the plans to expand to all five boroughs. How do you see this network helping underserved communities and turning wi-fi into a public utility?\n"Cities across the world are dealing with the issue of internet access. In New York, there\xe2\x80\x99s something like 2.5 million people in the city that don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to high-speed internet. We\'re part of changing the infrastructure of the city to democratize communications for everyone. We hope, and we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing it, that Link is becoming something that\xe2\x80\x99s being used by people from every background."\nPeople have been playing YouTube videos and having impromptu dance parties in the street.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the next step, and how does this network create a backbone for more smart city technology?\n"The next step is deploying more of the Link units, that\xe2\x80\x99s our first concern. We\xe2\x80\x99re still in beta, and learning. There are a lot of new test cases for the tablet itself that\'s built into the kiosk, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been toying around with lots of different ideas. One day people could perhaps vote on these things. We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in pursuing these sorts of idea with the city, our big partner in this. I\xe2\x80\x99m really excited about future technology and AI; we think about Link as an open platform. Perhaps one day we could hold a hackathon to determine future use cases."\nWhat criteria are you using to make sure this is helping all New Yorkers?\n"We\xe2\x80\x99ll see it replace the entire payphone system. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be some greenfield sites, and in places where there are banks of phones, we\xe2\x80\x99ll replace them with just one or two Links. The idea is to have them where people are, so you know, there is heavily trafficked area where people live, work, and travel. In and of themselves, they\xe2\x80\x99re reflective of New Yorkers. There will be greenfield sites that we will create to fill in the gap. But for the most part, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be replacing the pay phone network."\nWhat are the other use cases you\xe2\x80\x99ve been considering with the tablets?\n"I suppose one of the immediate potential use cases is allowing people to make free video calls, not just voice calls, which would be a cool and interesting one. I think as these use cases develop, we want to make sure Link is open to including new ways of approaching different problems and challenges."\nThere have been a lot of discussion about the security and privacy implications of using this system. Can you explain from the perspective of someone walking down the street and linking to the network, how their privacy will be respected?\n"We have always taken privacy and security incredibly seriously. We set out to create the most robust, citizen-first privacy policy we could. To begin with, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a new user, when you begin the enrollment process, you only need to provide a very small amount of data, just an email address. Consider what you need for home email service, a credit card and sometimes even a social security number. So it requires a much smaller amount of personal data. We also anonymize and aggregate data. Our privacy policy dictates we\xe2\x80\x99ll never share any personally identifiable information, an email address or a name, with a third party. From a security perspective, we use end-to-end encryption, bank-like encryption. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time public wi-fi has had end-to-end encryption like this. We\xe2\x80\x99re pretty focused on making sure people fall in love with Link and use it every day, and to do that, we need to put them first, we can\xe2\x80\x99t compromise them in any way. That\xe2\x80\x99s our raison d\xe2\x80\x99etre."\nThis is free for the city, but not a free system. it\xe2\x80\x99s supported by advertising. What kind of data will be utilized by this advertising? What will be collected and utilized, and how will it offer new advertising opportunities?\n"We know the exact location of every Link, and can utilize the time of day to deliver more relevant information. We don\xe2\x80\x99t just tell you about stadiums or teams, we tell you who\xe2\x80\x99s playing where and when. We have the ability to understand demographics with a variety of different measurement tools. That allows you to understand different locations and think about audiences with much more granularity. Both of those tools are becoming more and more dynamic, they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming more analogous to the type of dynamic digital measurement that exists online. You can think about the composition of an audience at a specific time, and trigger a change in advertising. You can use third-party data sets, and that gets really interesting. You can adjust to events like weather. The kiosk could say, there will be sideways rain at this location in several minutes; buy an umbrella or get an Uber. In the case of an advertising campaign with StreetEasy, we displayed nearby apartments and property. We have super fast wi-fi, so you can download the app to look at the apartment very quickly. In effect, we create this closed ecosystem; giving consumers a message and the bandwidth to take the next action."\nWhat do you define as success with the LinkNYC program?\n"When we came up with the idea for LinkNYC, we were inspired by Google Maps and YouTube. Really, none of us think about them as advertising platforms. They\xe2\x80\x99re products that people use everyday and have become an integral part of everyday life. And they\xe2\x80\x99re given away for free, they\xe2\x80\x99re just supported by advertising. I think at the very first stages, when we were thinking about Link, we wanted to create the best possible product. For instance, once you\xe2\x80\x99re on the network, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to re-authenticate, because if you had to, it would be a bad experience. Once we\xe2\x80\x99re further down the road with roll-out, and it becomes a contiguous online experience for those walking and traveling throughout the city, and people just switch over to it without thinking, then they\'ll see how it changes their online behavior. They won\xe2\x80\x99t need to wait to go to work to do heavy lifting such as uploading photos. We can show them how to save money on their data plan. For us, keeping a close eye on usage is a measure of success. And as I said earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a great start with the rollout thus far, and exactly where we want to be."\n"As far as advertising is concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s about encouraging brands who haven\xe2\x80\x99t advertised in physical spaces before to try out Link. That would be a real measure of success, being able to show them we can deliver the creative and strategic potential of the internet in public. Think of newsprint, when you see, say, a Labor Day sale in the paper. With the proliferation of displays on the Link network, we can offer huge impact on those types of campaigns that traditionally wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use this kind of advertisement."\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting since we have so many LinkNYC kiosks, and they have a place and role in people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives. When the sad news of Muhammad Ali and Prince broke earlier this year, we pretty much instantly posted creative that really mirrored back the emotion of the city and connected the infrastructure of the city to its heartbeat. The Olympics is coming up, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in seeing how that works with Link. We\xe2\x80\x99re also interested in expanding to global cities, and other cities in the United States."\nWe have a million screens in our lives, and now this is another screen offering a new means of communication.\n"What\xe2\x80\x99s new is the additional context. There used to be very one-dimensional context to signs; put it up for four weeks, no editorial, no value proposition, no updates, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. No dynamism. With Link, we hope to not just solve the issue of technical inequity, but help bring about a smarter and more reactive city. And the network is going to be so fast, the phone will be the roadblock, not the network."\nHow do you create something in a public space that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add more visual pollution or white noise, something people like as opposed to a screens everywhere, Blade Runner type situation?\n"Well, all that stuff I said about context is key. Design is also hugely important. We worked with Antenna design, urban architects who have won many awards, and we\xe2\x80\x99re proud of the way Link looks. When you see a unit on the street, it looks like an enduring part of the city. And of course, over the course of the 12-year contract, we\xe2\x80\x99ll update both the software and the hardware. Messaging and content are really important, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just started figuring that out. Being part of the zeitgeist can help. We did this interesting campaign with Shazam where we surfaced live Shazam data; here are the top 10 songs people are listening to right now. And so, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Sade on the West Side, and I was doing an interview on Turtle Bay, and Sonny Rollins was number two, in the neighborhood. That was pretty great."\nThese kiosks will also have sensors to measure data such as pollution levels. Will those be open source, and will the data be available to others seeking to build their own apps?\n"Definitely. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the city and Argonne National Labs on how to put sensors in the kiosks that will measure information such as congestion, noise pollution, etc. We will have an incredible amount of new data, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in seeing what people do with it."\nNext Up In\nUrban Planning\nHow Mayor Pete used good urbanism to revitalize South Bend\nSidewalk Labs\xe2\x80\x99 new app helps designers and planners study how public spaces are used\nWhy U.S. cities need to learn from Copenhagen\xe2\x80\x94fast\n8 ways cities are transforming urban rooftops\nHow Seiichi Miyake\xe2\x80\x99s tactile blocks changed cities\nCan self-driving cars really make cities safer?\nMost Read\nWant to understand U.S. real estate trends?

Every wonder what happened to all those phone booths? In New York, they\'re being converted into free municipal Wi-Fi hotspots.It\'s part of an effort called LinkNYC. It\'s described as a first-of-its-kind communications network designed to bring fast municipal Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers and tourists at no cost. The network is being fleshed out through five boroughs at no cost to taxpayers. Instead, it will general hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for New York over the next 12 years primarily through advertising.New York is converting old phone booths into free Wi-Fi hotspots and digital hubsWorkers can already be seen installing LinkNYC hubs in certain parts of New York, The goal is to install around 7,500 hubs throughout the city, each of which will replace a telephone booth. Converted hubs will not only serve as Wi-Fi hotspots, but will also be equipped with USB ports for charging mobile devices, touchscreens for browsing the web, and big size displays to serve up advertisements. In addition, users will be able to make free phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. using the integrated tablet and microphone (you can plug in your headphones for more privacy).As for wireless speeds, officials claim LinkNYC\'s gigabit Wi-Fi is up to 100 times faster than the average public Wi-Fi that\'s available in parks and cafes. It also promises to be much faster than 4G LTE connections, provided you\'re within 150 feet of a Link.Though construction has already begun, there will be an initial beta phase to try out some of the features and provide feedback. After that, LinkNYC will roll out additional apps an services over the next few months and "on an ongoing basis over the next several years."\nTags:\nNew York, wireless, LinkNYC, wi-fi\nVia:\nThe Verge\nShow comments\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nFollow Us:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\nAppStore\nGoogle+\n85K\n12K\n32K\nNext Show TBD\nCONVERSATIONS\nAMD Zen 3 Ryzen, Threadripper And...35\nMicrosoft Next Gen Anaconda Xbox...27\nMan Receives 84-inch LG TV From...25\nCyberpunk 2077 Vastly Different Now...10\nFlexible Facepalm, Samsung Galaxy...5\nApple\xe2\x80\x99s Sinister Plan To Squeeze...5\nUS DOJ Has Serious Concerns About...5\nFEATURED\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 16 Series...\nIntel Launches New 9th Gen Mobile...\nIntel Optane Memory H10 Review:...\nCrucial P1 SSD Review: Nimble NVMe...\nMaingear Vybe 2019 Review: Fast,...\nGigabyte Z390 Designare Review: A...\nAlienware Area-51m Review:...\nFAVORITES\nBest Ethereum Mining GPUs - A...3473K\nSamsung SSD 970 Pro And 970 EVO...1189K\n6 TB Hard Drive Round-Up: WD Red, WD...810K\nIntel Core i7-6700K And Z170 Chipset...652K\nQuadro P6000 And P5000 Review:...649K\nAMD Ryzen Review: Ryzen 7 1800X,...594K\nIntel SSD 750 Series PCIe SSD Review:...588K\nYour Next GPU\nRadeon VII\nGeForce RTX\nNext AMD\nNext NVIDIA\nIntel In 2020\nMore Results\nMORE HOT HEADLINES\nApple Pushes MacBook Keyboard...\nSony\'s 4K Flagship OLED TV Family...\nRazer Blade Pro 17 And Blade 15 4K...\nOnePlus 7 Series Snapdragon 855 5G...\nA Wonderful Super Mario Bros...\nTeen Slaps Apple With A $1 Billion...\nTesla Claims Its New Self-Driving...\nSITE\nHome\nReviews\nNews\nBlogs\nFull Site\nSitemap\nCATEGORIES\nPC Components\nSystems\nMobile\nIT/Enterprise\nLeisure\nVideos\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nAdvertise\nNews Tips\nContact\nHotTech Vision And Analysis\nMORE\nForums\nShop\nSTAY CONNECTED\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nFeedburner\nThis site is intended for informational and entertainment purposes only.

LinkNYC, a public-private partnership between the city and a consortium of technology companies, has debuted its first two payphone-turned-tech kiosks in Manhattan. These gleaming aluminum "Links," as they are called, contain Wi-Fi beacons, mobile device chargers and informational tablets that include an app allowing free phone calls to anywhere in the country. The city plans to roll out 500 more of them by July and to have at least 4,550 spread across the five boroughs by 2020.\nThe Links are an early example of efforts by cities across the country to retool their public rights of way to provide better services and even generate revenue. In the case of LinkNYC, that revenue comes from advertisements that light up 55-inch HD screens on each side of the kiosks, changing every 15 seconds. The ad revenue will be split between the city and CityBridge, the designer and operator of the Links. The city is guaranteed at least $500 million over the next 12 years.\nThat arrangement is leading some to raise questions about privacy. Ad space on the Links is so valuable because of the user information (including IP addresses, GPS location and browsing data) that allows advertisers to deliver highly targeted content to passersby. The back end works similarly to ad-targeting algorithms users encounter while surfing the Web.\nRELATEDKC Kiosks Avoid LinkNYC\'s Porn Troubles, Rollout Going SmoothlyAfter Users Watch Porn, New York City Removes Web Browsing from LinkNYC KiosksNew York City Chief Digital Officer Bids Farewell \xe2\x80\xa6 for NowIn a recent article in The Conversation, Benjamin Dean, who researches Internet governance and cybersecurity at Columbia University, wrote that "far from being free, use of LinkNYC comes with the price of mandatory collection of potentially sensitive personal, locational and behavioral data." To underscore this point, he cited a Pew Research Center survey in which nine in 10 adults said that "being in control of what information is collected about them is important."\nA more recent Pew report, however, found that "there are a variety of circumstances under which many Americans would share personal information or permit surveillance in return for getting something of perceived value." That "something" might be a social media platform, a search engine -- or ubiquitous wireless Internet where payphones used to be. To echo the Pew report, "Free is a good price."\nLinkNYC has a transparent privacy policy promising that no personally identifiable information will be shared outside of CityBridge. But as with all public services, users must assume some risk. Even with the cybersecurity protections CityBridge has built into the Links, it still falls on users to make informed choices when connecting their devices to new sources of Internet service. As the Wall Street Journal\'s Joanna Stern put it in a recent video feature on LinkNYC, "You wouldn\'t use a public toilet without the proper precautions. Don\'t use a public hotspot without them either."\nCertainly privacy is a real concern in any public-private partnership involving citizens\' data. High-profile data breaches at the federal-government level and concerns over exploitive corporate data-mining practices have rightly elicited unease. But municipal governments have sustained a good track record so far. As partnerships of this sort become commonplace, cities have an opportunity to raise the bar and chart a path as public stewards of citizens\' information.\nIt remains to be seen whether LinkNYC\'s privacy protections will be as customer-focused as promised. But if it holds up, it will be a big step in advancing the city\'s tech ecosystem in a common direction, whether in city agencies, emerging start-ups in "Silicon Alley," schools in underserved communities or -- yes, the curbs of city sidewalks.\nThis column is part of a Better, Faster, Cheaper series\xc2\xa0featured on Governing, following the ways in which states and municipalities are reimagining public infrastructure as an underdeveloped resource.

aS"LinkNYC: Wi-Fi kiosks delayed in city\xe2\x80\x99s poorer boroughs | StateScoop\nSubscribe\nAbout\nRSS\nBrought to you by\nSpecial Reports\nState\nCity\nCounty & Local\nWatch\nListen\nAttend\nContent Studio\nLinkNYC: Wi-Fi kiosks delayed in city's poorer boroughs\nShare\nWritten by Alex Koma\nNov 18, 2016 | STATESCOOP\nNew York City now boasts hundreds of LinkNYC kiosks that provide free Wi-Fi service \xe2\x80\x94 with more on the way \xe2\x80\x94 but one city lawmaker shared concerns that low-income neighborhoods are getting left behind.\nCouncilmember Jimmy Vacca held a hearing on the issue\xc2\xa0Tuesday as part of his Committee on Technology, pressing city IT leaders and their private sector partners for more details on their timetable for installing at least 7,500 kiosks by 2024.\nWhile Vacca praised the project for how it \xe2\x80\x9ccontinues to level the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d and get New Yorkers better internet access, he also expressed worry that Manhattan enjoys an outsized advantage.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight now, we have more kiosks in Manhattan than in the other four boroughs combined, and that is inequitable and unfair,\xe2\x80\x9d Vacca said. \xe2\x80\x9cMany of these kiosks are in high-end neighborhoods that have access to Wi-Fi, but in neighborhoods that are poorer or middle income, they may never see these kiosks, or may see them 12 years from now.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications oversees LinkNYC, while CityBridge \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0 a group of tech companies including Qualcomm and Civiq Smartscapes \xe2\x80\x94 assumes responsibility for installation of the kiosks in exchange for the advertising revenue generated by the project. That bargain may be letting the city offer the service at no cost to taxpayers, but Vacca said those profit incentives \xe2\x80\x94 not concerns of equity \xe2\x80\x94 are guiding CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the project.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rationale is that people in higher income neighborhoods with more money will see those advertisements and spend money on those products, while people in poorer neighborhoods in the outer boroughs don\xe2\x80\x99t have that disposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d Vacca said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t provide the bang for the buck that advertisers want, and that\xe2\x80\x99s called inequity.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStanley Shor, assistant commissioner for franchise administration with the city\xe2\x80\x99s IT department, acknowledged that the city is indeed a bit \xe2\x80\x9cbehind schedule\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to installing kiosks in the city\xe2\x80\x99s outer boroughs.\nA report by committee staff confirms this. A city contract with CityBridge set a goal of 510 kiosks operational by fiscal year 2016, and while the city has 558 kiosks installed, only 434 are active, owing to technical difficulties. Analysts also found that the city has just two of a promised 20 kiosks installed in Staten Island \xe2\x80\x94 neither of which are active \xe2\x80\x94 while Brooklyn has only two functional kiosks of a scheduled 62.\nBut Jen Hensley, general manager of the LinkNYC program for CityBridge, stressed that there are mitigating circumstances that explain those delays. In Manhattan and the Bronx, Hensley said her workers could easily get access to conduit systems to install the equipment, but Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of infrastructure in the other boroughs complicates the process.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found that 21st century infrastructure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit neatly in a 20th century footprint,\xe2\x80\x9d Hensely said.\nHensley noted that Verizon has \xe2\x80\x9cstrict policies and guidelines for third parties who want to do work in Verizon-managed manholes,\xe2\x80\x9d necessitating months of coordination with the telecom giant just to secure inspectors to accompany CityBridge workers for even basic tasks. In Staten Island, she added that much of the infrastructure is mostly on utility poles, forcing the company to negotiate a \xe2\x80\x9cwhole new agreement\xe2\x80\x9d with Verizon, further slowing work.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of this means that before construction can even begin, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with partners for a minimum of five months and as much as a year,\xe2\x80\x9d Hensley said.\nCityBridge does share the city\xe2\x80\x99s equity goals, Hensley insisted, as evidenced by its work to install roughly a quarter of its kiosks in Upper Manhattan near Harlem.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the pace pick up significantly in the outer boroughs in the coming weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nShor added that the city is keeping a close eye on CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s progress, and plans to fully review the consortium\xe2\x80\x99s work by the time they reach the contract\xe2\x80\x99s second anniversary in July 2017.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody wants to have them not meet their numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d Shor said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t look good, we don\xe2\x80\x99t look good.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut he also warned Vacca that even if the contract is fulfilled on schedule, the outer boroughs will still not\xc2\xa0have as many\xc2\xa0kiosks as Manhattan. Once the project is finished, he predicted that half of all the kiosks built will be in Manhattan.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s still a bias towards Manhattan because of its enormous central business district, and the whole premise is that this is being paid for by advertising, which is extremely valuable in Manhattan,\xe2\x80\x9d Shor said.\nThat explanation did little to placate Vacca.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore this all started, I expressed concern that advertisers would want only Manhattan and told this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the case,\xe2\x80\x9d Vacca said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told, \xe2\x80\x98No, there will be equity.\xe2\x80\x99 This, to me, is not equity and only goes to reinforce my original belief. It was unacceptable then and it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable now.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShor insisted that the his hands are tied in that department, but noted that the contract allows for the city to opt for the construction of an additional 2,500 kiosks once the 2024 deadline arrives, which could mean other boroughs eventually get more attention. But, he admitted that other neighborhoods may need to rely on other projects to achieve the internet access promised by LinkNYC.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the only way broadband is coming to other parts of the city,\xe2\x80\x9d Shor said.\n-In this Story-\nBroadband, Digital Services, equity, IT Infrastructure, Mobility, New York, Smart Cities, State & Local News, States, Tech News, Wi-Fi\nRelated news\nCity\nNew York City hires Obama administration tech adviser as CTO\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 2 mins ago\nCity\nWhy local governments should lead multi-jurisdiction disaster response\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 3 hours ago\nCity\nSt. Louis IT agency revised security policies after audit, CIO says\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 1 day ago\nAd Specs\nSponsor\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Scoop News Group\n|\nAll Rights Reserved\nSearch for:\nThe latest state and local government tech news, delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

aS"Free, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots launch in NYC -- GCN\nThe Technology that Drives Government IT\nAI & AutomationCybersecurityCloud & InfrastructureData & AnalyticsSmart Cities & IoTEmerging TechState & LocalMoreEventsResourcesNewslettersContactAdvertiseReprintsList Rental\nFree, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots launch in NYC\nBy Derek MajorJan 29, 2016\nThe first of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC kiosks went live for beta testing Jan. 19, marking the city\xe2\x80\x99s first step in its plans to provide free, high-speed Wi-Fi.\nLinkNYC aims to create a communications network with its 7,500 Link stations that will be erected across the five boroughs by 2020, with 500 being installed by this summer.\nBACKGROUNDER\nNYC replacing payphones with Wi-Fi hotspots\nWi-Fi network connection points will be installed in NYC public payphone kiosks, replacing the aging devices. The hotspots will also still include an option for voice services and offer free calling to 911 and 311 (June 2014). Read more.\nNYC transforms pay phones into Wi-Fi network\nNew York City will install multi-function, Wi-Fi-based phone kiosks across the city offering free gigabit Wi-Fi and free domestic calls across the United States (November 2014). Read more.\nThe beta phase begins a handful of operational kiosks, each of which will allow users within 150 feet to connect to the LinkNYC gigabit\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi network. The kiosks are powered by an all-new, purpose-built fiber optic network that will deliver speeds up to 100 times faster than average public Wi-Fi, LinkNYC said.\nCityBridge, the consortium of technology firms building LinkNYC, is investing more than $200 million to install hundreds of miles of new fiber optic cable that will deliver gigabit connectivity to Links stations.\nAn Engadget writer who tested the service shortly after it became operations said he was getting 300 megabit/sec Wi-Fi access, much faster speeds than are typically available in coffee shops and most residences.\nThe kiosks\xc2\xa0will contain a built-in tablet allowing users to browse the web and access city services, maps,\xc2\xa0 directions and a 911 emergency call button. People can charge their mobile devices through USB ports, and using the Vonage app on the tablet, can make free phone calls anywhere in the United States, including to 311, 411 and 911. Links kiosks also have two 55\xe2\x80\x9d high-definition digital screens used for public service announcements and advertising, which helps fund the stations.\nAdditional apps and services will be rolled out over the next few months, according to the LinkNYC FAQ.\nLinkNYC has two networks: LinkNYC Free Wi-Fi and LinkNYC Private. The open network relies on web server-based SSL security to protect the information passing between a device and the Link. The private network secures all wireless communications between devices and the Link, regardless of whether a website uses SSL security, the FAQ explained. During the beta phase, the private network requires an iOS device and Hotspot 2.0 technology that lets a device verify the authenticity of the \xe2\x80\x98LinkNYC Private\xe2\x80\x99 network. The network is one of the first in the country to offer an encrypted public network at this scale, according to a post by Intersection on Medium.\nEven so, as the kiosks will be used to browse the web via public Wi-Fi, some are concerned that they pose security risks.\nHackers can \xe2\x80\x9cbreak into them and put information on them to use as a keylogger\xe2\x80\x9d to collect passwords, said Tyler Cohen Wood, a cybersecurity adviser to Inspired eLearning. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re on the public network and sending sensitive information, you\xe2\x80\x99re on a network with potentially hundreds other people [who] have the ability to really see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo keep the Link stations secure, CityBridge will install cyber protections, including a series of filters and proxies to block anyone who tries to download malware during a browsing session, The Verge reported.\nThe city will also monitor traffic to stop users from receiving data from a command-and-control server. And if malware is installed on a LinkNYC tablet, it would soon be deleted. \xc2\xa0The devices go through a hard reset after 15 seconds of inactivity, according to The Verge\xe2\x80\x99s report.\nFor those who are still uneasy about the security on public networks, Cohen Wood suggested they being wary supplying email addresses or other personal information to access hotspots.\nAbout the

aS'New York\'s Free Wi-Fi Is Fast, Free and Super-Secure, But It Comes at a Price\nSubscribeSubscribe to Mic DailyWe\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a rundown of the top five stories every daySign me up Getty ImagesNew York\'s Free Wi-Fi Is Fast, Free and Super-Secure, But It Comes at a PriceBy\xc2\xa0Ruth Reader\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0Jan. 25, 2016Last week, New York City started rolling out what is expected to be the largest public Wi-Fi project in the world: new Wi-Fi hubs placed in the antiquated telephone booths scattered around the city.\xc2\xa0The breadth of the program is impressive: It spans all five boroughs and will bring to the city a total of 7,500 Wi-Fi hotspots, the majority of which will be deployed by 2020. The network&aposs speed is enviable; at over 200 Mbps, the download and upload speeds blow your standard Time Warner Cable package out of the water. But the most exciting aspect of the new network isn&apost its power or accessibility \xe2\x80\x94 it&aposs the security. You&aposll have the option to browse the web safely, with end-to-end encryption.Source:\xc2\xa0Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe public Wi-Fi problem:\xc2\xa0Public Wi-Fi is notoriously insecure; one 2011 study found\xc2\xa088%\xc2\xa0of public wireless networks\xc2\xa0weren&apost protected with an encryption key.Though connecting to wireless internet at a Starbucks may seem innocuous, it&aposs anything but. That&aposs because most Wi-Fi implementations are open networks. When connecting to the internet through a cafe network, on a bus or in a train, there are no barriers preventing someone from viewing your computer.How? Public Wi-Fi is prime environment for hackers to weasel in between you and the website you&aposre sending information to, allowing them to see all your traffic before it arrives at its intended destination.\xc2\xa0While websites that use encryption protocols like HTTPS (signified by that lock image in your browser bar) provide some protection against threats, there&aposs plenty of opportunity for human error. Simply navigating to your bank&aposs website could inadvertently expose you to a hacker threat. Seemingly legitimate websites can be frauds luring users to enter their login information and effectively hand over their personal data to hackers.Outside of what&aposs called a man-in-the-middle attack, there are more nefarious forms of hacking,\xc2\xa0like malware. For instance, a hacker can launch a pop-up window at the start of a session, invite you to click and then download software automatically onto your computer without you being the wiser. "The interesting thing is, when you do go through these devices, you assume they are secure,"\xc2\xa0Paul Nicholson,\xc2\xa0product marketing director of security firm A10 Networks, told\xc2\xa0Mic. "But there&aposs always the worry that there&aposs something intercepting in the middle."Source:\xc2\xa0Getty ImagesThis is why encryption matters:\xc2\xa0Given that most public Wi-Fi is unsafe, it&aposs particularly interesting that LinkNYC is offering users the opportunity to encrypt sessions end-to-end. End-to-end encryption means that communications can only be decrypted by the person receiving the message using a system of private keys.\xc2\xa0"On a public network, we treat everyone as their own network. No device can see any other device and nothing is shared between devices,"\xc2\xa0Colin O&aposDonnell, chief technology officer of CityBridge, the consortium running LinkNYC,\xc2\xa0told\xc2\xa0Mic.The feature is opt-in, so users have to choose to use it. This is so LinkNYC can download a device-specific key to the phone requesting encryption. That provides a small hurdle for those who may not know what encryption is. But, O&aposDonnell told\xc2\xa0Mic,\xc2\xa0CityBridge will also be deploying street teams near LinkNYC hotspots tasked with teaching the general public how to safely use public Wi-Fi and how to activate encryption. Safety tips include making sure you&aposre actually connecting to LinkNYC and not a spoofed version of the network, avoiding sites that aren&apost secured with HTTPS, and refraining from downloading files from unknown third parties. O&aposDonnell also says that CityBridge has a team monitoring the network around the clock for potential threats and abnormal activity. Given that one of the members of\xc2\xa0CityBridge is telecommunications giant Qualcomm, the security team is likely fairly robust. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Source: YouTubeYour data: LinkNYC&aposs\xc2\xa0Wi-Fi system is free, but there is a hidden cost. In order to fund this project, LinkNYC needs to make money. Like many tech platforms, it can do that through ads.\xc2\xa0For now, each station will feature a physical advertisement. LinkNYC will also serve patrons an ad when they first connect to the network. To serve up these ads to the right audience at the right time, the network relies heavily on anonymized user data. But rather than track web behavior, O&aposDonnell told\xc2\xa0Mic,\xc2\xa0LinkNYC uses outside information to know who you are and what you like.Using a device&aposs unique ID, LinkNYC can collect physical data about you that isn&apost tethered to your name, but rather a tokenized number. "We have points all across the city for lengths, and we know which lengths are near Barclays Center and we know when the Nets are playing versus when a Justin Bieber concert is,"\xc2\xa0O&aposDonnell said.\xc2\xa0"So you can start to build profiles about a place and specific time that&aposs really valuable to advertisers."LinkNYC plans to launch 7,500 Wi-Fi hubs in total, with 4,500 coming by 2020.\nLinkNYCLinkNYC does not directly share data with advertisers, O&aposDonnell said;\xc2\xa0it uses the data internally to help brands place ads. However, it will be sharing aggregated and anonymized user data it collects with the city&aposs Open Data Platform.\xc2\xa0It also plans on expanding the kind of data it collects from users. The consortium is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory\xc2\xa0and New York City to develop new ways of using smartphone sensors to collect information.\xc2\xa0For example, vibration detectors can sense how often buses are rumbling by a given location, while cameras can see how many bicycles are on a street or determine the speed of traffic."We think we can do something really special here by creating a really powerful network that generates insights and making those available to the public so that we can have researchers think about how to correlate air quality and populations and how people flow through the city," O&aposDonnell told\xc2\xa0Mic. "A lot of them, frankly, could be about equity and connectivity in the city and where we need to plan future deployments or address digital-divide issues."In taking advantage of these sensors, the CityBridge (and by extension the city) will have to navigate how to access these sensors in a way that doesn&apost violate user privacy. However, if LinkNYC can find a way to gain the public&aposs trust in an appropriate way, the payoff could be\xc2\xa0crucial urban innovation.

The current policy states that CityBridge \xe2\x80\x9cwill take reasonable attempts to notify you of such a request, to the extent possible,\xe2\x80\x9d which the NYCLU says fails \xe2\x80\x9cprovide any assurance to users that they will be notified of government requests for information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdditionally, CityBridge\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy only offers to make \xe2\x80\x9creasonable efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to clear out personally identifiable user information, and that will only happen once a user has 12 months of inactivity on the network. That means New Yorkers who use LinkNYC regularly will have their personally identifiable information stored for years and possibly for the rest of their lives, NYCLU said.\nAbout the Author\nDerek
