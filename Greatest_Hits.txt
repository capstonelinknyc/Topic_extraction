Advertising on the kiosks will support the gigabit-speed Internet service.\nGigabit speed is 20 to 50 times faster than the broadband found in many homes and 100 times faster than the average public Wi-Fi speed. A gigabit-speed connection would allow a movie to be downloaded in less than a minute, as opposed to more than an hour using a typical public connection.\n"We think it is going to be the fastest Internet experience [many people] have ever had," said Colin O\'Donnell, chief technology officer of CityBridge member-company Intersection, at a press preview with city officials Monday afternoon. "We think there is a huge opportunity to drive change in the industry."\nFormed last year from the merger of outdoor advertising firm (and pay phone operator) Titan and tech firm Control Group, Intersection is leading the rollout as part of a public-private partnership.\nIn February, the trial phase will take another step forward as the kiosks\' tablet component goes live, allowing users to make phone calls\xe2\x80\x94for free within the U.S.\xe2\x80\x94or search the Web. By June more than 500 kiosks, reaching into all five boroughs, will be up and running.\nMore than 4,500 links will be operating within four years.\n"We\'ve been doing a lot of things," said Anne Roest, commissioner of the city Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, at the press event. "But none of the things we\'ve done have the potential to impact the equity issue of broadband access like Link NYC does."\nRelated Articles\nDe Blasio administration goes after Verizon for failing to deliver FiOS\nVerizon\'s defense doesn\'t ring true\nAmazon to ban sale of Apple, Google video-streaming devices\nInternet providers investigated for slower-than-advertised broadband speeds\nPandit-backed lending startup gets $275 million from Barclays, Macquarie\nAIG invests in worker-protection startup Human Condition Safety\nCuomo presses restart on long-sought Penn Station overhaul\nIBM\'s Watson flexes muscles with Under Armour partnership\nCharter\'s $57 billion Time Warner Cable acquisition approved by state\nIBM leads with most U.S. patents for 23rd year in a row\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain\'s New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain\'s Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

(CityBridge)\nSay goodbye to New York City\'s payphones as they get replaced with modern-looking Wi-Fi kiosks.\nLinkNYC, a product of CityBridge technology consortium, is rolling out a fiber optic network of kiosks that offer an array of free services including high speed Internet, web browsing, cell phone charging and phone calls to anywhere in the U.S.\nAdvertisement\n"It\'s going to be the largest and fastest public Wi-Fi network in the world," Collin Odonell, managing member of CityBridge, said in a press briefing. "It\'s really the first of this kind of network and it\'s going to transform the streets and people\'s way to access information."\nThe Link kiosks will offer an array of free services including high speed Internet, web browsing, cell phone charging and phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. (CityBridge)\nLink Kiosks will be installed all across the five boroughs including downtown and northern Manhattan, south Bronx, Jamaica, Queens, Flatbush Ave., Brooklyn and St. George, Staten Island. (CityBridge)\nThe $200 million project is expected to bring in $500 million for the city and it won\'t cost taxpayers any money.\nSome of the selected areas to have Links by July include downtown and northern Manhattan, south Bronx, Jamaica, Queens, Flatbush Ave., Brooklyn and St. George, Staten Island.\nThe first two kiosks, which are called "Links" and stand a bit over at 9 feet tall, will be unveiled Tuesday on 3rd Ave. at 15th and 17th street, but they won\'t be fully functional until mid-January.\nEach kiosk will offer up to 1,000 Mbps Internet speeds, which is much higher than the 8.7 Mbps average speed of public Wi-Fi services in the U.S. It\'s also much faster than the average LTE speed, which falls at 6.5 Mbps. The gigabit kiosks will also be able to support hundreds of users using its Wi-Fi up to a 400 foot radius.\nPrivacy might be a concern for many, but the Links will have features that keep users secured.\nUsers will have the option to join a private network that is encrypted and won\'t track them while they browse. Users will also have the option to clear their sessions once they\'re done using the kiosk. Yet, it\'s still recommended not to log into banks accounts over public networks.\nLinkNYC will track usual technical network information such as MAC addresses and other small identifiable information.\nThat might concern some people with being tracked, but CityBridge\'s commitment to net neutrality guarantees that users\' information will remain private and won\'t be shared with any third party.\nThe only exception would be if the information is part of a criminal investigation and it\'s summoned by law enforcement. CityBridge has already put together a Privacy Policy that details what the company does with users\' personally identifiable information.\ntechnology\nAdvertisement\nRecommended', b"You\xe2\x80\x99ll Find The Safest Free Internet Connection With These City Wi-Fi\nFast CompanyCo.DesignTechWork LifeCreativityImpactAudioVideoNewsRecommenderSubscribeHomepageCo.DesignTechWork LifeCreativityImpactAudioVideoNewsRecommenderSubscribeHelp CentercollectionsRecommenderThe apps, books, movies, music, TV shows, and art are inspiring our some of the most creative people in business this monthStrong Female LeadThe struggles and triumphs of prominent women in leadership positionsProductivityProductivity tips and hacksPlatform WarsThe major tech ecosystems that battle for our attention and dollarsTech ForecastWhat\xe2\x80\x99s next for hardware, software, and servicesMost Innovative CompaniesOur annual guide to the businesses that matter the mostMost Creative PeopleLeaders who are shaping the future of business in creative waysWorld Changing IdeasNew workplaces, new food sources, new medicine--even an entirely new economic systemInnovation By DesignCelebrating the best ideas in businessFastCo.Works StudioAn award-winning team of journalists, designers, and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company's distinctive lensNewsletterEventsInnovation FestivalThe GrillCurrent IssueCurrent IssueSUBSCRIBEFollow us:advertisementadvertisementadvertisement01.06.16elasticityYou\xe2\x80\x99ll Find The Safest Free Internet Connection With These City Wi-Fi NetworksSan Francisco, San Jose, and now New York City are using much better wireless security than you get at Starbucks or your hotel.\n[Photo: Flickr user Jiuguang Wang] By Sean Captain4 minute ReadThis week, New York City officially inaugurated its free citywide Wi-Fi network, LinkNYC, though it will take several months to get going: 510 access points, called kiosks, are promised\nby July. The city touts some big stats in its fact sheet: 7,550 kiosks to be installed, with 4,550 in the first four years, all providing gigabit connections. Way down at the bottom is the vague phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC offers an encrypted public Wi-Fi network, adding a critical layer of protection to personal data.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s actually the most exciting news in the release: one of the first big uses of a new Wi-Fi technology called Passpoint, aka Hotspot 2.0.advertisementadvertisementPublic Wi-Fi networks are usually about as clean as public toilets. Many offer no security at all. That splash screen you see when you log on at Starbucks asks you to agree to, among other things, the fact that the connection is not secure. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a typical open hotspot\xe2\x80\xa6where you connect and get that web page, that Wi-Fi connection is not encrypted,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kevin Robinson, a VP at the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry organization that certifies products as supporting the Wi-Fi tech standards. \xe2\x80\x9cThat traffic is happening in the clear.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, anyone on the network can see what anyone else is doing.What about those coffee shops that write a username and password on the chalkboard next to the seasonal drink specials? \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it or not, that actually does provide a pretty strong level of security,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robinson. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though they are sharing a username and password, each one of those connections has a unique [encryption] key to the network.\xe2\x80\x9d The question is: Which network? \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an increased\xe2\x80\xa6number of people who would operate fake networks\xe2\x80\xa6 just to collect data,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ond\xc5\x99ej Vl\xc4\x8dek, COO of antivirus maker Avast. They can use the same or a similar name for their bogus network, protected by the same username and password.\nRelated\nThe Top Three Online Security Menaces You Should Worry About In 2016\nLinkNYC and networks already up and running in San Francisco and San Jose provide a new, safer, and much simpler kind of security as part of a tech standard called Passpoint\xe2\x80\x94one of the most important words you probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard. Passpoint allows a Wi-Fi hotspot to work roughly the same way that a cellphone tower does. Your connection can switch seamlessly from one hotspot to the next as you move down the street, with no need to log in again to each new station.That\xe2\x80\x99s super-convenient, and can save people a lot of money on their wireless data plans by offloading traffic to Wi-Fi. But Passpoint is a boon even to people who sit next to the same hotspot all day: an individualized secure network connection that (in theory) can\xe2\x80\x99t be spoofed by a hacker. Passpoint actually uses the same security standard, called WPA2, that many access points have offered for years.With Passpoint, rather than signing on to a single access point, you sign on\xe2\x80\x94just once\xe2\x80\x94to the service provider that operates networks of hundreds or thousands of access points; and you take your WPA2 encryption with you. Some networks even have roaming agreements, as cell carriers do. You can automatically and securely hop between San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s and San Jose\xe2\x80\x99s systems, for example. In addition, a phone, laptop or other device that supports Passpoint holds a list of digital certificates that verify if a network is a legitimate Passpoint provider.Why Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Everyone Using This?The Wi-Fi alliance has been certifying new products that support Passpoint for less than two years. If your laptop, phone, or tablet is older than that, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capability. (Robinson says that chipmakers may be able to add Passpoint to older gear with a software update.) Even if your device has certified hardware, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the Passpoint feature has been enabled in the operating system. The rule of thumb is that you need\xe2\x80\x94depending on the device\xe2\x80\x94at least Android 6.0, iOS 7, Mac OS X Mavericks, or Windows 10.advertisementNetworks\xe2\x80\x94especially the free ones\xe2\x80\x94are also slow to upgrade to Passpoint. The ability to hand off from hotspot to hotspot is almost essential for municipal systems like that in San Francisco, as well as for paid global Wi-Fi services like Boingo or Time Warner Cable\xe2\x80\x99s hotspot network (which both recently upgraded to Passpoint). But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer much to Joe\xe2\x80\x99s coffee shop or Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hotel, where users are stationary. Yes, the Passpoint security is much better, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if most people will skip their soy latte because the caf\xc3\xa9 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer a new Wi-Fi standard they probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t even heard of. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, what you may call a sole proprietor [such as a] caf\xc3\xa9 deploying a Passpoint network,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robinson.Instead, the next place you will see Passpoint is probably via cellphone providers, such as T-Mobile, which are already conducting trials of the technology. \xe2\x80\x9cAs those trials conclude, we\xe2\x80\x99ll expect to see additional Passpoint deployments,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robinson.So what\xe2\x80\x99s the takeaway for itinerant web users? Best-case scenario: Connect to the nearest Passpoint network if your town has one and your device supports it. Even if you are sitting right next to the router in your caf\xc3\xa9, go for the public hotspot across the street, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a street in San Francisco or San Jose or (soon) New York. Somewhat more likely scenario: Connect to a network that requires a username and password. Otherwise, you have a box of lesser options. The best is to subscribe to a virtual private network (VPN) service such as Cloak or HMA (or the VPN your company may supply) that creates an encrypted connection for you\xe2\x80\x94protecting your data even if it\xe2\x80\x99s running through a hacker\xe2\x80\x99s fake Wi-Fi hotspot. At the very least, make sure the website you are going to uses the HTTPS address that signals web encryption. \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, people are going to make their own decisions on how much risk they want to assume,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robinson.advertisementadvertisementadvertisementAbout the authorSean Captain is a Bay Area technology, science, and policy\njournalist.

But my iPhone is on fire. After connecting to one of LinkNYC\'s gigabit wireless hotspots, the futuristic payphone replacements that went live for beta testing this morning, I\'m seeing download speeds of 280 Mbps and upload speeds of 317 Mbps (based on Speedtest\'s benchmark). To put it in perspective, that\'s around ten times the speed of the average American home internet connection (which now sits at 31 Mbps). And to top it all off, LinkNYC doesn\'t cost you a thing.\nGallery: Hands-on with LinkNYC | 9 Photos\n9\n+5\nOf course, my experience was a charmed one. The LinkNYC hotspot (or Link, for short) I tested went live just a few hours before I arrived, and there were only a handful of other people on it. I was also standing right in front of it -- speeds will vary depending on your distance, as well as the type of device you\'re using. Still, seeing Speedtest\'s bandwidth meter rocket to 300 Mbps was astonishing. It felt like I was staring at the future of urban internet access in my cold, gloved hand.LinkNYC is the culmination of New York City\'s big push to modernize payphones. Its tall and thin kiosks feature gigabit fiber connections (yes, most are plugged right into fiber lines) delivered via 802.11ac WiFi, USB charging, free voice calls, and a tablet for internet access, maps and directions. They also sport two large screens which display ads (the only way LinkNYC is making money, at the moment), as well as public service announcements. Wireless range clocks in at 150 feet, though as always, that may be affected by obstacles, windows and walls. Each kiosk also offers a private, fully encrypted network accessible by devices that support Hotspot 2.0 (at this point, LinkNYC only supports Apple gear).Signing onto a Link for the first time was surprisingly easy, as far as WiFi onboarding goes. After joining the "LinkNYC Free Wi-Fi" network, you just need to plug in your email address into a landing page to get connected. If you\'ve got a Hotspot 2.0 device, you\'ll automatically get a prompt to install a security key for the the private LinkNYC network. I had no trouble connecting to the kiosk with my MacBook Air while sitting in the Starbucks right in front of it.The process was a bit more complex for my iPhone, since I wanted to test out LinkNYC\'s encrypted offering. After receiving the prompt to install the additional security key, I had to manually approve it and restart my WiFi before my phone phone would hop onto the private network. Unfortunately, while I wanted to test out LinkNYC\'s estimated range this morning, my iPhone ended up dying before I could (likely because I had it exposed to the extreme cold for a while).On my MacBook Air, I saw speeds of around 70 Mbps up and down while sitting just a few feet from the Link. That speed was likely being limited by my laptop\'s connection to AOL\'s VPN, which can\'t be disabled easily. Being indoors definitely slowed things down a bit as well, but that\'s still insane speed for free WiFi. It\'s likely a great deal faster than your home internet connection, unless you\'re paying for an expensive 100 Mbps plan.Even with slower speeds at greater distances, I wouldn\'t be surprised if some New Yorkers end up dumping their home ISP and using Links full-time instead. LinkNYC representatives say they won\'t stop anyone from doing that, though they might have to throttle data hogs who end up ruining the experience for others. Links could also end up being a major gateway to the internet for millions of New Yorkers who can\'t afford service at home.When it comes to security, LinkNYC won\'t be able to detect anything you\'re doing on its private network. On its public network, though, it\'ll be able to track your MAC address. (Update: Representatives tell me LinkNYC won\'t track any web traffic on its public or private network.) The full privacy policy, published by NYC\'s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), notes that Citybridge (the consortium behind LinkNYC) might share anonymized data with third-parties, but not anything personally identifiable.While there are only a handful of kiosks installed at the moment, LinkNYC plans to have 500 up and running by July. They\'ll remain in beta testing until around 200 units are deployed, according to representatives, and by 2020 the group plans to have at least 4,450 kiosks in the wild. It\'s tough to tell if LinkNYC will reach its long-term goals, but the fact that it was able to develop and deploy its kiosks in about a year is impressive.\nIn this article:\nculture,\ngear,\ngigabitWiFi,\ninternet,\nLinkNYC,\nNYC,\nWiFi\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

I tried them, so take it from me: They\xe2\x80\x99re insanely fast. How fast? Fast enough that Starbucks\xe2\x80\x99 free internet is about to get killed. Earlier this month, we reported on LinkNYC, the Big Apple\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to roll out breakneck internet access to everyone. Today, the first four modules are open in beta mode to the public.Advertisement The 9.5-foot-tall rectangles, which are replacing the city\xe2\x80\x99s pay phones, feature USB outlets for charging your devices (actual charger not included), city maps, 911 emergency access, and video calls to anywhere in the country. And, of course, wi-fi. Fast wi-fi. I ran internet speed tests at various locations this morning, with the goal of comparing a NYCLink location (at 15th Street and 3rd Avenue) to other common spots where I often score free wi-fi. Those included a Starbucks, a New York City subway platform that offers gratis wireless, and the Gawker Media offices. The winner? LinkNYC. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even close. Like, at all.AdvertisementHere\xe2\x80\x99re the results of a test I ran on the LinkNYC public wifi:AdvertisementAnd at the Starbucks located right next to the Link:AdvertisementFinally, from the F and M train platform at 14th Street:AdvertisementLinkNYC is ten times faster than New York\xe2\x80\x99s existing public internet, and infinitely quicker than Starbucks. With city internet that fast, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Panera, or other establishments whose complementary wifi is such a pull? After all, if you want to work or study at a place that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the library or your house, you pretty much have to buy a mocha and camp out. And with the sheer number of Links that New York is planning to install\xe2\x80\x947,500 units in the next 12 years, each with a service radius of up to 400 feet\xe2\x80\x94it could mean that you and your devices will never be outside a serviceable zone.AdvertisementStill. These things aren\xe2\x80\x99t designed to have people convene in front of them to stream Orange Is the New Black en masse. (Although the folks at LinkNYC have said the system can handle that.) They\xe2\x80\x99re designed for temporary, fleeting experiences: checking your email, downloading a map of the city, making a quick Skype call. AdvertisementWhether LinkNYC will complicate the city\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with chains and businesses remains to be seen. For now, the units are still being tested (911, calls, and maps aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet available), and they seem to be advertisers more than anything, with signs hawking Coors Light and Citibank. You can use the wi-fi, of course\xe2\x80\x94you just need to input an email address. (LinkNYC says that it will never give out private user information.) And in case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, no sites are blocked from the network. Want to download some sleaze on a park bench? Go for it...I guess?AdvertisementFor now, the city wants to open up ten new Links a day, with the goal of 500 running by July. Let the mass, ultra-fast streaming begin.

The first LinkNYC hub was installed in December, but today is the first day New Yorkers have been able to use it to connect to the internet.\nToday\'s rollout is also a test of the LinkNYC network, which provides newly laid fiber to each hub. The network is still officially in beta, and the group anticipates some changes as the network expands, but the current version is significantly faster than many commercially available connections. A Verge test found both upload and download speeds faster than 300 Mbps. "The device is usually the bottleneck," said Miles Green, head of network engineering at Intersection.\nConnecting to the network takes users to a login screen, shown below, where they are asked to provide their email. LinkNYC officials say emails are collected for informational purposes only and will not be sold or shared, in accordance with the system\'s privacy policy. Notably, that single login will keep users connected across the entire system, regardless of which hub is closest at a given time.\nThe current rollout is proceeding up Third Avenue, but organizers say LinkNYC booths will begin the trek up Eighth Avenue over the next several weeks. By mid-July, the city plans to have 500 such hubs installed throughout the city. When the project is complete, it will include more than 7,500 hubs throughout the five boroughs. Each hub will include two USB charging ports, touchscreen web browsing, and two 55-inch ad displays.\nMore From\nThe Verge\nGood Deals\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro is cheaper than ever today\nPlus, deals on the 11-inch model, the S10 lineup of phones, and more\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s Galaxy S10 lineup\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 8.

Within minutes you know what is happening in your office, your neighborhood and the world at large. Throughout the day, you continue to interact with a series of devices that keep you socially and professionally connected.\nFor a lot of us, this describes our routine. But for too many New Yorkers, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even come close.\nIn 2011, the United Nations declared access to broadband Internet a basic human right and a global priority. Five years later, 34 million Americans still lack access to broadband. The digital divide affects even the most tech-savvy cities, including New York. One in four New Yorkers lacks access to high-speed Internet at home. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than 2.5 million people who can\xe2\x80\x99t search for a job, do homework or manage their health care without going to a library or a McDonald's.\nMobile access is often seen as a cheaper and more convenient substitution to household Internet. For those who can afford it, unlimited data means ubiquitous connectivity. For those who can\xe2\x80\x99t, data is a prized commodity. Shelling out an extra $60 a month on top of cellular charges simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option for the many New Yorkers who already pinch pennies just to afford rent, food and child care. And overage charges of $15 per gigabyte can throw a tight household budget into crisis.\nAs\xc2\xa0Mayor Bill de Blasio rolls out universal computer-science classes in public schools, it is our obligation to ensure that our kids can get online to become 21st-century innovators, no matter their zip code. And the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s investment in free, high-speed broadband to more than 21,000 public housing residents will bring broadband access to some of the New Yorkers who need it most.\nThe latest effort, LinkNYC, can make a huge difference for families and individuals who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford more data\xe2\x80\x94but still need the Internet for nearly every aspect of their lives.\nBy replacing New York City\xe2\x80\x99s pay phones with more than 7,500 super-fast, free Wi-Fi hotspots, or \xe2\x80\x9cLinks,\xe2\x80\x9d we will dramatically increase access to free broadband Internet across the five boroughs. These Links will also provide other free services, including domestic phone calls, a tablet for Internet browsing, 911 and 311 calls, and USB device charging. Last month, we launched LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s beta phase in Manhattan, and by summer there will be more than 500 Links installed across all five boroughs.\nThe LinkNYC network has the potential to help millions of New Yorkers get and stay connected even if they lack a mobile device or just can\xe2\x80\x99t afford expensive data plans.\nLinkNYC represents a new kind of public-private partnership, one that leverages the innovation and agility of the private sector without costing taxpayers or users a dime. In fact, with its robust network of over 12,000 digital advertising displays, LinkNYC will generate more than half a billion dollars in revenue for New York City over the next 12 years.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a model other cities can and should emulate. By delivering a free, premium user experience, we will create more economic opportunity, capacity for innovation, educational access and civic participation. And yes, there will still be enough bandwidth to download that HD cat video, too.\nMaya Wiley is counsel to the mayor. Jen Hensley is general manager of LinkNYC.\nRelated Articles\nQuestion for pols: Who's going to pay for all this?\nRikers reimagined: Innovative ideas to turn the infamous island into a New York\xe2\x80\xa6\nU.S. cannot make Apple unlock an iPhone, at least in Brooklyn drug case\nSolution to the city's old call-box problem is right in front of us\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain's New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain's Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

A winner will be announced in June.\nThe program, for medium-size cities with populations of up to 850,000, will award up to $40 million for building a smart transportation system that ultimately includes connected vehicles and self-driving cars.\nThe kiosks, modeled after the LinkNYC network that is currently replacing New York City\'s old pay-phone infrastructure, will take up approximately 25 city blocks. They will be part of a transportation data and analytics platform called Flow, Doctoroff said on the call along with Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\nSidewalk Labs will be developing Flow in the coming months with the Smart City program\'s seven finalists, which Foxx announced at the South by Southwest festival last week. They include Denver, Austin, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.\n"Flow offers unprecedented citywide transportation analytics to help cities understand congestion and identify areas underserved by transit using aggregated anonymized data," Foxx said on the call.\nFlow will collect data from mobility apps and from Wi-Fi kiosks and help city governments and residents better manage traffic and test new options like ride-sharing and other transportation alternatives.\nSidewalk Labs, which is building LinkNYC through its Intersection subsidiary, has said that it wants to expand its Wi-Fi hotspot technology beyond New York. And Flow, which will be provided gratis to the winning metropolis, will become another one of Sidewalk Labs\' offerings as it begins working with other cities.\nCiting the pressure that poor transportation options put on low-income communities, Doctoroff said that technology offers cities a rare chance to make current infrastructure more workable.\n"We know we\'re not going to build more roads," Doctoroff said. "It\'s hard to invest in meaningfully more mass transit. We have to do better with what we have."\nRelated Articles\nConsumers coming over to Apple\'s side in dispute with feds\nWeWork to raise $430 million for expansion in Asia\nTop local venture capitalist sides with Obama on Apple encryption fight\nGoogle veteran joins Oscar as chief technology officer\nPATH joins MTA and Amtrak in banning hoverboards\nCUNY, Cornell Tech launch women-in-tech initiative\nDaily fantasy sites agree to stop taking bets in New York\nIPhone hearing canceled as FBI tests hack without Apple help\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain\'s New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain\'s Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

Mr. Arroyo said he lives across the street and had run out of available minutes on his phone plan.CreditCreditBenjamin Norman for The New York TimesBy Patrick McGeehanJuly 26, 2016When it comes to acceptance of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly growing network of sidewalk kiosks offering \xe2\x80\x9cfree super fast Wi-Fi,\xe2\x80\x9d some people are Nekeya Browns and some are Alex Padillas.As soon as the LinkNYC booths were activated in their Washington Heights neighborhood this month, Ms. Brown celebrated by plugging in her headphones and swaying to some Marvin Gaye tunes; Mr. Padilla, in his Yankees jersey, stood a few feet back, reluctant even to touch the keyboard for fear of having his pocket of personal data picked.Mr. Padilla, 60, said his primary concern was \xe2\x80\x9chaving to give them information,\xe2\x80\x9d not that he was certain who \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d were. Ms. Brown, a young woman in brightly patterned tights, was practically giddy as she appraised a glowing kiosk on West 142nd Street in Manhattan.\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever thought of this was a great person,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, listing all of the benefits of the kiosks. \xe2\x80\x9cI told a homeless lady that whenever you need to call your family, you can use this.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd so it goes in the first stage of the citywide rollout of these curbside machines that promise swift connections to the internet, phone service and ports for charging cellphones and other devices, all at no cost to the users. With the activation this week of the first units to be installed in Queens, there will be about 300 online, almost all of them in Manhattan.Along Eighth Avenue in Midtown, some homeless people are camping around the kiosks. Sascha Freudenheim, who runs a consulting firm on West 36th Street, said the way some people were using the kiosks \xe2\x80\x9cseems completely counter to their purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Freudenheim said he thought they would be used to help people find their way around the city, not serve as gathering spots.Residents of more residential neighborhoods have complained that the kiosks are too bright, too loud and more attractive to idle squatters than they are to busy passers-by in need of a quick connection. Other New Yorkers are demonstrating their usual skepticism, eyeing the kiosks warily and wondering what the catch is.Aniya Lee, 16, frequently uses the kiosk at 183rd Street and Creston Avenue in the Bronx, but only to play songs on YouTube on the video screen. She said she did not feel comfortable using the Wi-Fi or connecting her phone to the USB outlet.\xe2\x80\x9cFor some reason, I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get everyone\xe2\x80\x99s information.\xe2\x80\x9dCity officials are hoping that the public\xe2\x80\x99s long-term relationship with the tall, slim kiosks settles in somewhere between standoffish and clingy. They admit they did not know what to expect; no other city has tried to create anything quite as extensive as LinkNYC.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an unprecedented project,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne Roest, commissioner of the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have to make adjustments to make them better. A lot of these things are things that really we weren\xe2\x80\x99t anticipating when we went live.\xe2\x80\x9dIf all goes according to the plan, the kiosks will be as commonplace as pay phones once were: more than 7,500, spread throughout every neighborhood of the city. Most of them will replace former pay phones, though the company installing them has begun choosing additional sidewalk sites.That company, actually a consortium known as CityBridge, is behind schedule on the rollout. Under its franchise agreement with the city, more than 500 kiosks were to be working by this month, in all five boroughs.ImageAlex Padilla, 60, looked over the LinkNYC kiosk at 135th Street and Broadway. Mr. Padilla said he had no use for the kiosks.CreditBenjamin Norman for The New York TimesCityBridge executives said their progress was slowed by several factors, including the strike by Verizon employees and a lawsuit filed by Telebeam, a company that controlled about 1,300 pay phones in the city. Telebeam challenged the city\xe2\x80\x99s granting of an exclusive franchise to CityBridge; a federal judge dismissed the suit this month.Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC, said some former pay phone sites had proven unsuitable for the kiosks. In those instances CityBridge has started seeking approvals from local community boards to place the machines in other spots.So far, most of the kiosks have been placed along Third and Eighth Avenues in Manhattan, aligned with fiber-optic cable already laid to provide fast wireless connections to the internet. After Queens, the network will extend to Brooklyn and then to Staten Island, Ms. Hensley said.CityBridge has only just begun to assess how successful the system is, Ms. Hensley said. But city officials said they were pleased with the early use and the adjustments CityBridge had made, including lowering the maximum volume at night in response to noise complaints.Nearly 275,000 people have registered to use the kiosks, which requires users to provide an email address. Once a smartphone is registered, it will automatically connect to the Wi-Fi signals that radiate from the kiosks and extend 100 feet or more.Close to one million of those connections are being made weekly, according to CityBridge statistics. In July, users initiated about 40,000 sessions on the built-in computer screens and made about 23,000 phone calls per week.Last weekend, experts on digital data and online privacy were wondering what CityBridge planned to do with all of the personal information made available. Benjamin Dean, a fellow in cybersecurity and internet governance at Columbia University, and Mariko Hirose, a senior staff attorney for the New York Civil Liberties Union, raised that question at a gathering of hackers in Manhattan.The civil liberties organization has asked city officials to revise LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policy, arguing that it allows the system\xe2\x80\x99s operators to collect all sorts of data about users and sell it to other companies. Ms. Hensley said CityBridge executives were working with city officials on revising the current policy.\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have plans to collect any additional data in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hensley said.Contrary to some people\xe2\x80\x99s fears, she said, the consortium is barred from sending ads to users\xe2\x80\x99 phones.\xe2\x80\x9cWe know way less about you than your mobile phone provider does,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.CityBridge maintains that its business model involves selling ads on the large, lighted panels on the sides of the kiosks, essentially small billboards that will line the busiest blocks of the city. It has pledged to share at least $500 million in ad revenue with the city over the first 12 years.But Mr. Dean said he was doubtful, in part because of the involvement of Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, Alphabet. It owns Sidewalk Labs, an investor in one of the members of the CityBridge consortium.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Google\xe2\x80\x99s doing here is taking the business model that they\xe2\x80\x99ve perfected in the online world and bringing it into the real world,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dean said in an interview.Despite the warnings of critics like Mr. Dean, city officials seem determined to push ahead with a network that they say will provide valuable benefits, to people much like Jose Soto, a 35-year-old Washington Heights resident.On a hot day in early July, Mr. Soto squatted in the shade near a LinkNYC kiosk, typing texts on his basic cellphone to his wife in Panama. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pay my internet this month,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is good for a lot of people.\xe2\x80\x9dSamantha Schmidt contributed reporting.

LinkNYC\nTo Court a Skeptical Public, New York Sends Wi-Fi Ambassadors\nEillie Anzilotti\nAug 12, 2016\nAs LinkNYC rolls out through the city, guides take to the streets to demonstrate how to use the free network. Share Tweet LinkedInEmailPrint\nMANHATTAN, NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 On a scorching morning, Stefan Carpio, a 26-year-old Bronx native, stands on the northwest corner of 150th and Broadway in Washington Heights, wearing a black T-shirt bearing this invitation: \xe2\x80\x9cAsk me about Link.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOK, what\xe2\x80\x99s Link?\nCarpio gestures to a sleek sidewalk kiosk equipped with a small touchscreen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got everything you would expect from your mobile phone or tablet right here\xe2\x80\x94maps, the internet, calling capability,\xe2\x80\x9d Carpio says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the free high-speed Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe kiosk is one node in the network that makes up LinkNYC, New York City\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to bring free internet to the city streets. New York is the first city to attempt this model of public web access, and since the program launched in January, residents are still acclimating to the presence of the monolith-like Link outposts. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Carpio says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people just stop and stare at the machines.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a member of the LinkNYC Street Team, which has been showing passersby the ropes of the network since the first machines were installed, Carpio brings a human face to New York\xe2\x80\x99s far-flung tech overhaul. A stack of instructional flyers under his arm, he mans the sidewalk in front of the kiosk, called out to the scattered morning crowds and offering them a quick tutorial on how to use the console. Carpio demonstrates how to browse the internet, charge a mobile phone, place a free call, or navigate through the city with the help of Google Maps. The interface is Android-esque; the wireless network extends out from the booth in a 150-foot radius, and passersby can log into the free network on their phones.\nTo date, around 350 Link kiosks have emerged from the graves of old pay phones; more than 350,000 people have registered to the network. The deployment cost over $200 million, but the network will come at no additional cost to the city or taxpayers; it\xe2\x80\x99s funded by ads that rotate across the screens on the sides of the kiosk. Over the course of an eight-year rollout, the number of kiosks will grow to anywhere from 7,500 to 10,000 throughout the five boroughs, pulling the number of network registrations up exponentially and generating over $500 million in advertising revenue, according to Jen Hensley, the general manager for LinkNYC.\nFor many, the presence of a Link kiosk is a mild convenience: one less trip into a Starbucks to mooch off the free Wi-Fi, or a chance to place a call from something larger than a deck of cards. There\xe2\x80\x99s a headphone jack, so you can dial the number on screen and place the call directly through the kiosk.\n"Forgot my phone this morning so I\'m calling my mom for her birthday. She thinks it\'s cool." - Chris, Hells Kitchen pic.twitter.com/5vC0Z1lwEw\n\xe2\x80\x94 LinkNYC (@LinkNYC) August 3, 2016\nBut for a substantial number of New Yorkers, public-facing technology is not just a plaything, but a bridge. Carpio joined the LinkNYC street team after completing a course in software testing at Per Scholas, a Bronx-based national nonprofit that connects unemployed or low-income people with free tech training skills. Prior to the course, Carpio says, he struggled to find a job; as one of the dozen or so Per Scholas graduates that now make up the LinkNYC street team, Carpio now works two five-hour shifts per week at the most recently installed kiosks, patiently walking people through the new additions to the neighborhood.\nPer Scholas managing director Kelly Richardson says the organization enrolls students of color at a rate of 90 percent. One-third are women; all come from low-income families. The student body in the Bronx center, Richardson says, \xe2\x80\x9creally looks like New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe internet access gap in NYC is greatest in black and Hispanic homes. And it\xe2\x80\x99s getting wider. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s the part of New York that\xe2\x80\x99s been left out of the increasingly internet-connected fabric of the city. According to a 2015 report from the Office of the New York City Comptroller, 26 percent of households in the city lack broadband internet access at home. That access gap is greatest in black and Hispanic homes, and demarcated along socioeconomic lines. And it\xe2\x80\x99s getting wider: The report notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe digital divide appears to be growing on a year-over-year basis, with poor neighborhoods of the South Bronx and Central and Eastern Brooklyn witnessing a decrease in the percentage of households with broadband.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe idea behind LinkNYC is to bridge these access gaps. Street team members like Carpio are working to ensure people are aware of the kiosks\xe2\x80\x94and how to use them safely.\nCities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about.\nSubscribe\nLoading...\nFrom the time of its initial announcement, LinkNYC has been met with skepticism about the omnipotence of its public-private ownership. The program is a joint venture between the City of New York and an amalgamation of tech companies called CityBridge, which, if one peels back the Russian-nesting-doll layers of ownership far enough, traces back to Google.\nThe fact that the Silicon Valley behemoth would be on the receiving end the location-tracking and web-browsing data from the Link network has been cause for concern\xe2\x80\x94particularly because, as The Atlantic previously reported, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford broadband access would be most likely to take advantage of a fast, free option for internet access like LinkNYC. And\xe2\x80\xa6low-income communities are already among the most surveilled in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn March, the New York Civil Liberties Union addressed a letter to the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling for heightened security across the network. In response, Link asserted the data collected will not be sold or distributed; any data shared with advertisers and the city would be made anonymous.\nCurrently, LinkNYC offers two connectivity options on mobile phones: the regular open network, and an encrypted, private network. The latter is more secure, but for the time being, available only on the newest Apple devices\xe2\x80\x94a disparity that drives another wedge between the socioeconomic sectors that Link aims to bridge.\nHowever, Carpio says he mostly sees people use the kiosks to make calls or look up directions, though he once helped someone search for a job. According to Link, the average network login session lasts around three minutes, not long enough to leave a substantial data trail. And street team members like Carpio are on hand to explain safe browsing practices (such as sticking to URLs that begin with \xe2\x80\x9chttps\xe2\x80\x9d) to boost privacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis a completely new use of the technology\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist anywhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d says LinkNYC GM Hensley. \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew that people would be curious about it, and that it might not be the most intuitive thing.\xe2\x80\x9d But as communication channels increasingly shift online, it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be more imperative that it\xe2\x80\x99s equally accessible to all New Yorkers. Someday, these Wi-Fi kiosks could be as familiar a part of the city\xe2\x80\x99s streetscape as phone booths were to New Yorkers of the 1970s.\nAbout the Author\nEillie Anzilotti\n@eillieanzi\nFeed Eillie Anzilotti is a former editorial fellow at CityLab.\nExpand Comments +\nMost Popular\nEnvironment Paris Wants to Grow \xe2\x80\x98Urban Forests\xe2\x80\x99 at Famous Landmarks The city plans to fill some small but treasured sites with trees\xe2\x80\x94a climate strategy that may also change the way Paris frames its architectural heritage.\nFeargus O\'Sullivan\nJun 19, 2019\nTransportation The World\'s 15 Most Complex Subway Maps As ranked by a research team of mathematicians and theoretical physicists.\nEric Jaffe\nFeb 25, 2016\nDesign How Birds and Bees Survive in the City Pollinators\xe2\x80\x94the wildlife that shuffle pollen between flowers\xe2\x80\x94are being decimated.

But predictably, New Yorkers mostly liked standing in front of them to watch music videos.\nSome, reportedly, managed to find a little porn, though as one woman charging her phone at an Eighth Avenue kiosk said Tuesday, the browser wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even let you get to Rotten.com, let alone porn being easily accessible. Rotten.com, a shock site, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s you see crazy things,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, acknowledging the street wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really the place for it. She declined to give her name, along with her two companions also charging their phones and sitting on a flipped-over Village Voice distribution container.\nThe porn/music-video/people-gathering nexus, combined with the particular people who often gathered to use the tablets \xe2\x80\x94 mostly homeless people and some mentally ill \xe2\x80\x94 resulted in complaints. Then last month, LinkNYC shut down all tablet-based web-browsing. The consortium that manages the kiosks released some preliminary findings since that experiment this week.\nTo browse, or not to browse is the question\nIts numbers suggest that more people could be getting their turn to call, check out maps, look at 311, and the other similarly banal tasks that are left when the internet is shut off. In the 11 days before web-browsing was turned off vs. the 11 days after, browsing sessions increased 12 percent.\nSome kiosk users queried on Tuesday didn\xe2\x80\x99t find the lack of browsing too problematic. Gill Diaz, 50, a part-time forklift operator from the Bronx, says he\xe2\x80\x99s tried to make important phone calls from time to time and people \xe2\x80\x9care out here watching videos.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut others predictably bemoaned the loss, like the three women sharing a Village Voice container and charging station on Eighth Avenue. One, in a poster example of the purposes of accessible browsing, said she looked up sites and info about potential jobs before the switch.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated multiple times when considering the change. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSign up for amExpress, the conversation starter for New Yorkers.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable question. Expanding internet access was one of the (laudable) goals of the kiosk program. While that didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean physical outposts, the tablets ended up bringing the internet to people who have trouble getting it elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 who are kicked out of Starbucks or McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s for trying to charge their phones, and briefly had surprisingly unfettered access in the one place that was their domain: the street.\nThat experiment made the streets too chaotic, in the view of some, so the entities that truly own the street \xe2\x80\x94 the city and its vocal businesses and citizens, not its homeless and others who spend lots of time on the sidewalk \xe2\x80\x94 shut it off.\nTurning watchers into voters\nBefore they did, it was a brief demonstration of internet habits in its own chaos put out in the open.\nPerhaps hoping to add a new draw to the kiosks now that the internet is gone, LinkNYC is launching a homepage allowing users to register to vote. Will civic duty be as big a draw as music videos or free porn?\nActually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a far-fetched connection. The ever-entrepreneurial website Pornhub recently announced that during the Sept. 26 presidential debate traffic to its website \xe2\x80\x9cfell as much as 16% compared to an average Monday in this time period.\xe2\x80\x9d The site often tracks porn-viewing fluctuations during live events and sometimes finds similar dips \xe2\x80\x94 during the Euro 2016 soccer final in July and the NBA Finals Game 7 in June, for example.\nThose NYC free internet users might not be that different from America\xe2\x80\x99s voting populace. But the voters presumably did their browsing at home.\nBy Mark Chiusano\nMark Chiusano is a member of the Newsday and amNew York editorial board.\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nComments\nWe're revamping our Comments section.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images)\nApparently porn surfing isn\'t the only activity the city\'s free Web kiosks are good for.\nA month after the kiosks\' web browsing capabilities were disabled \xe2\x80\x94 following rampant complaints about people hogging them to oogle porn \xe2\x80\x94 officials say they\'ve seen a 12% rise in usage.\nAdvertisement\nThat increase is boosted by more New Yorkers using the kiosks\' tablets to make phone calls, access 311, and get web-based directions from navigation services, according to LinkNYC, the private company the city contracted with to launch the services.\nLast week alone the kiosks were used to make 21,000 free phone calls, according to Link NYC.\nAt the same time, calls to the company complaining that people were hogging the kiosks dropped 82%, LinkNYC said.\nThe city announced it was disabling the web browsing capabilities last month because of complaints of people monopolizing the machines \xe2\x80\x94 including well-publicized incidents of people watching porn.\nThe hundreds of kiosks, which are located in Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, are replacing outdated payphones and includes tablets and Wi-Fi hot spots free of charge.\nOfficials said Tuesday that as of the end of September, 576,321 people had used the Wi-Fi services \xe2\x80\x94 more than the population of Atlanta, Miami, and Oakland.\nlinknyc\ntechnology\nAdvertisement\nRecommended', b"The 27 Most Innovative Spaces And Places Of The Year\nFast CompanyCo.DesignTechWork LifeCreativityImpactAudioVideoNewsRecommenderSubscribeHomepageCo.DesignTechWork LifeCreativityImpactAudioVideoNewsRecommenderSubscribeHelp CentercollectionsRecommenderThe apps, books, movies, music, TV shows, and art are inspiring our some of the most creative people in business this monthStrong Female LeadThe struggles and triumphs of prominent women in leadership positionsProductivityProductivity tips and hacksPlatform WarsThe major tech ecosystems that battle for our attention and dollarsTech ForecastWhat\xe2\x80\x99s next for hardware, software, and servicesMost Innovative CompaniesOur annual guide to the businesses that matter the mostMost Creative PeopleLeaders who are shaping the future of business in creative waysWorld Changing IdeasNew workplaces, new food sources, new medicine--even an entirely new economic systemInnovation By DesignCelebrating the best ideas in businessFastCo.Works StudioAn award-winning team of journalists, designers, and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company's distinctive lensNewsletterEventsInnovation FestivalThe GrillCurrent IssueCurrent IssueSUBSCRIBEFollow us:advertisementadvertisementadvertisement10.11.16innovation by designThe 27 Most Innovative Spaces And Places Of The YearFrom hospitals and houses to subway signs and parks, these projects are reshaping the world around us.\nBy Katharine Schwab9 minute ReadHow can cities build infrastructure today to support tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly increasing urban population, which the UN says will only increase in the coming decades? Over the past year, we saw designers, architects, and urban planners hard at work finding new ways to think about housing and improve public spaces. They range from new construction\xe2\x80\x93micro homes and prefab houses\xe2\x80\x93to various forms of adaptive reuse, with derelict urban spaces finding second lives as environmentally friendly parks and arts centers.advertisementadvertisementThe winners and finalists in the Spaces, Places, and Cities category of Co.Design\xe2\x80\x98s Innovation by Design Awards exemplify the move toward focused, thoughtful design for communities. Here are the 27 best projects of the year.Winners\nCarmel Place\nFirm: nARCHITECTSCarmel Place is New York City\xe2\x80\x99s first micro-unit building, where modular units averaging 300 square feet were prefabricated off-site and then stacked to create a tower of compact, tiny living spaces. So life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite so cramped for those inside, the building devotes more space to communal amenities, like a gym and public roof terrace. It\xe2\x80\x99s one alternative to the housing shortages gripping many expensive cities, New York included.\nHunts Point Landing\nFirm: Mathews Nielsen Landscape ArchitectsMeet the micro-park. This 100-foot-wide park and pier in the South Bronx brought new life to a tiny sliver of land located in an industrial zone and polluted shoreline as part of the South Bronx Greenway Master Plan. Mathew Neilsen Landscape Architects transformed a dead-end street into 1.5 acres of vibrant, community-minded green space, taking on the New York City bureaucracy to make it happen.Finalists\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaying The Groundwork\xe2\x80\x9d Design Guidelines\nFirm: Design Trust For Public SpaceadvertisementPublished by the Design Trust for Public Space in partnership with the N.Y.C. Department of Housing Preservation and Development, this design bible acts as a guide to the intricacies of urban design. Its nine core commandments focus on the ground floor of buildings in particular, exploring how retail and community spaces can be integral parts of every community. The guide gives architects and developers a set of best practices on how details like bench placement and electrical service can make them more usable and even more social.\n1.8 London\nFirm: Studio EchelmanThis web-like sculpture suspended over London\xe2\x80\x99s Oxford Circus is actually a visualization of the 2011 T\xc5\x8dhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. At night, visitors can use their smartphones to influence the patterns of light projected onto the dynamic sculpture, which is named for the number of microseconds the day was shortened when the earthquake hit.\nBiodesign Studio\nFirm: Local ProjectsThis permanent exhibition at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California, allows visitors to gain a deeper understanding of synthetic biology, bioengineering, and biological design. How? Hands-on, interactive labs let visitors do things like hack live bacteria\xe2\x80\x99s DNA to make it change color or \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d their own digital creatures. It takes an incredibly complex emerging field of science, and makes it tangible through space and exhibition design.\nBlackbirds\nFirm: Bestor ArchitectureadvertisementThis cluster of 18 homes in the Los Angeles hills could be an answer to the future of urban housing. The homes were designed to maximize the number of single-family homes in a given area. The two- or three-bedroom homes fit together to look like a single house, complete with a courtyard and shared outdoor spaces, increasing density without appearing to do so.\nBrooklyn Boulders Urban Design And Architecture Strategy\nFirm: Brooklyn BouldersRock climbing gyms are on the up-and-up\xe2\x80\x93but could they also serve as community hubs? One New York-based mainstay, Brooklyn Boulders, builds its gyms in neglected places, providing colorful, art-covered climbing walls in old factories and unused churches. But these are more than exercise spaces\xe2\x80\x93the company also uses its facilities for community events and concerts.\nChicago Riverwalk\nFirm: Ross Barney Architects, Sasaki\nThis open pedestrian walkway along the Chicago lakefront has been in the works since 2001, and the latest major addition adds three distinct sections of public space. There\xe2\x80\x99s the Marina, where pedestrians can watch boats come and go while they dine or stroll. The Cove, with boating and kayak rentals. And the River Theater\xe2\x80\x93a public amphitheater right on the water. It\xe2\x80\x99s a car-free pedestrian environment, designed to handle the Windy City\xe2\x80\x99s annual flooding while still providing a beautiful place to walk along the water.\nClover\nFirm: Mathieu Lehanneur\nadvertisementThis design for Paris\xe2\x80\x99s streetlights is a refreshing update to the city\xe2\x80\x99s classic art nouveau posts, with digitally manufactured wooden bases made of different grains that represent cities across the country, and efficient LEDs that are partially powered by a solar dome on top of the entire structure. Tr\xc3\xa8s chic!\nHavemeyer Building\nFirm: Common LivingCommon is in the middle of the coliving craze, providing housing for young urban professionals who want maximum flexibility and minimum hassle. You can apply online for one of the Havemeyer Building\xe2\x80\x99s 51 private bedrooms (stocked with Casper mattresses), and management keeps all the shared spaces clean and stocked with necessities. Say good-bye to buying toilet paper or fighting over who takes out the trash.\nConnected Worlds\nFirm: Design I/OThis immersive installation inside the New York Hall of Science\xe2\x80\x99s Great Hall Building is like a giant, virtual world (complete with a 45-foot waterfall) built out of projectors and Kinect cameras that visitors can manipulate. Connected Worlds is designed to help kids understand the trade-offs and advantages of sustainability as they explore a wildly complex, abstracted environment much like our own.\n\xe2\x80\x9cForest Of Light\xe2\x80\x9d\nFirm: Sou FujimotoadvertisementCreated for the fashion label COS, this installation from architect Sou Fujimoto uses a bare minimum of materials to create an immersive spatial experience. Architectural beams of light paired with sound, fog, and mirrored walls converge as a mystical environment that reacts to visitors.\nForest Of Light, The Asia Culture Center\nFirm: Kyu Sung Woo ArchitectsThis park in the city of Gwangju, South Korea, has exhibition spaces, libraries, performance halls, and a children\xe2\x80\x99s museum\xe2\x80\x93not to mention gardens, playgrounds, a tree park, and a grand lawn. It\xe2\x80\x99s all in service of revitalizing the city\xe2\x80\x99s identity and providing it with a cultural centerpiece.\nBut the complex also serves as a memorial and monument to the Gwangju Uprising, when hundreds of people died revolting against the dictator Chun Doo-hwan in 1980.\nGenerator Amsterdam\nFirm: DesignAgencyDo all hostels have to be dingy? Not according to Generator Amsterdam. Located in the Dutch capital\xe2\x80\x99s hip Oost neighborhood, this hostel is full of lounges, bars, and designer wallpaper\xe2\x80\x93with no lumpy mattresses or bedbugs in sight.\nHudson Yards Public Square And Gardens\nFirm: Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape ArchitectsadvertisementThis elevated public park, which will be situated over New York City\xe2\x80\x99s new Hudson Yards neighborhood, is being built on a steel platform on top of old railroad tracks. In short, it\xe2\x80\x99s a park that floats. And to support the growth of 30,000 plants and 200 mature trees, it will use jet engines for ventilation, a 60,000-gallon irrigation system, and \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d soil that will allow trees to grow in just four feet of dirt.\nLinkNYC\nFirm: IntersectionNew York City is in the process of replacing its 7,500 antiquated booths with new kiosks that offer free Wi-Fi, phone calls, and device charging, all powered by digital advertisements on the sides of the kiosks. Even though they\xe2\x80\x99ve been controversial since their rollout, LinkNYC offers a vision for the future of connectivity in cities.\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s Centre Barts\nFirm: Steven Holl ArchitectsHospitals rarely feel like healing spaces. The U.K.-based Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s Centres provide comfortable environments for cancer patients to heal, without the clinical coldness for which hospitals are so often known. The latest location in London takes that dedication to warmth and recovery to the next level, with a public roof garden that features space for yoga and tai chi and a beautiful translucent facade inspired by musical notes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new vision for how hospital architecture should look and function.\nMaven\nFirm: GMadvertisementCar-sharing services have their perks, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t ensure that your next car will already be tuned to your favorite radio station or the chair set to the position that most suits you. This experimental program from GM allows car-sharers to set up their preferred settings via an app, which can communicate with the OnStar system inside the next car they\xe2\x80\x99ll be driving. The app also allows the user to control the interior settings on their smartphone while inside the car, regardless of what make or model they\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in.\nMercedes-Benz Stadium\nFirm: HOKThe new home stadium for the Atlanta Falcons has a semi-transparent retractable roof that resembles a camera\xe2\x80\x99s aperture, a striking departure from most stadiums\xe2\x80\x99 roofs, which mimic the design of a convertible car. When closed, the roof hosts a large screen to envelop fans in 360-degree video. The finished stadium will receive LEED certification\xe2\x80\x93a first for professional sports arenas.\nMuji Hut\nFirm: MujiThe Japanese lifestyle company\xe2\x80\x99s first prefabricated house follows its broader design ethos. It\xe2\x80\x99s highly functional, with just enough design to be beautiful as well. The three houses are simply adorned but aesthetically pleasing, their compact design revealing how the company envisions its products, both small and large, augmenting urban lifestyles.\nRockaway Beach Boardwalk\nFirm: Pentagram, WXYadvertisementAfter Hurricane Sandy took out a chunk of Rockaway Beach\xe2\x80\x99s boardwalk in Queens, Pentagram stepped in to help rebuild the walkway. The agency was in charge of signage, which it built right into the new boardwalk, with massive 150-by-50 foot letters that can even be read by planes in the air. To beachgoers, the words \xe2\x80\x9cRockaway,\xe2\x80\x9d composed of a subtle blue hue, blend into the walkway, a striking combination of signage and environmental design.\nSquare, Inc. Headquarters\nFirm: Bohlin Cywinski JacksonThe mobile payment company\xe2\x80\x99s San Francisco headquarters are housed in what was once a windowless data center for supercomputers\xe2\x80\x93but you\xe2\x80\x99d never know it. The company\xe2\x80\x99s four floors are grounded by a central staircase that takes the city boulevard as its inspiration, with Square-enabled vendors selling coffee and sandwiches along the edges of these \xe2\x80\x9cstreets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStarter Home*\nFirm: Office Of Jonathan TateCities and suburbs are littered with wasted spaces that are too small for conventional homes. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Starter Home* comes in, with a strategy to transform these vacant lots into micro homes that a wider range of people can afford. A 195-square-foot proof-of-concept settles between a duplex and an industrial warehouse in New Orleans, and there are more Starter Homes on the way in New Orleans, Austin, Houston, Pittsburgh, and Oakland.\nThe Kathleen Grimm School For Leadership And Sustainability At Sandy Ground\nFirm: Skidmore, Owings & MerrilladvertisementNew York\xe2\x80\x99s first net-zero-energy school uses 50% less energy than your average New York City public school to serve nearly 450 elementary schoolers. How? It\xe2\x80\x99s all about efficiency and lighting. The building uses photovoltaic solar panels to collect energy, and is oriented along a strategic \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9d shaped plan to increase daylighting. Plenty of skylights and reflective ceiling panels take advantage of every last drop of natural light, too.\nThe Smithsonian National Museum Of African American History & Culture\nFirm: Adjaye AssociatesBritish starchitect David Adjaye designed Washington\xe2\x80\x99s latest addition to the National Mall\xe2\x80\x93a museum dedicated to the history and culture of African-Americans in the United States. The multilayered facade resembles an inverted ziggurat, covered in detailed ironwork made by African-American artists that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to allow light into the museum\xe2\x80\x99s interiors.\nThe Strand, American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.)\nFirm: Skidmore, Owings & MerrillThe Strand is a former 725-seat abandoned movie theater that was given new life as the home for the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect example of preserving a building\xe2\x80\x99s history and character while repurposing it to a new purpose: The renovations preserved the building\xe2\x80\x99s facade and some of the original decorations, marquee letters, and even graffiti, but the interior is decidedly modern, with a giant LED screen dominating the lobby.\n[Photo: Craig Dugan Photography]\nUniversity Of Minnesota Health, Clinics & Surgery Center\nFirm: CannonDesignadvertisementThis University of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s health center reimagines what a hospital can be, with no private offices or front desk. Instead, patients are checked in via iPad by staff members who come to them\xe2\x80\x93and rooms are available by reservation. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new way of thinking about how space can be effectively used to promote healing. No one likes going to the hospital, but details like these can go a long way to improving the experience.advertisementadvertisementadvertisementAbout the authorKatharine Schwab is an associate editor based in New York who covers technology, design, and culture.

The installation of Wi-Fi kiosks across the city\xe2\x80\x94582 and counting\xe2\x80\x94has attracted more and more users during the past few months.\nA comparison of typical periods from last month and September reflects the change. Wi-Fi sessions on LinkNYC kiosks were 51% higher during the week of Jan. 9 than during the week of Sept. 26. Over that time frame, New Yorkers logged more than 5.4 million hours on the free Wi-Fi.\nThe Links kiosks, which replaced pay phones scattered throughout the city, provide free Wi-Fi, phone calls and USB charging. Originally internet browsing services were available via each kiosk's built-in tablet. The internet service proved to be problematic, though, as people complained that homeless and other users were monopolizing the kiosks, often using the tablets to view pornography. The tablets were disabled in mid-September, and the kiosks received a software update.\nSince the reboot, the number of people using the Wi-Fi has surged, although the figures are not comparable to earlier data. A LinkNYC spokeswoman said the improved numbers reflect more accurate usage statistics following the software update. The number of sessions per week has increased since the software tweak.\nThe kiosks are making an economic impact on the city. LinkNYC's owner, CityBridge\xe2\x80\x94a consortium of four firms including Qualcomm\xe2\x80\x94estimates that the program created 350 direct full-time jobs last year, plus 265 jobs coming via multiplier effects. Those 615 workers took home $68.4 million in income, creating $128.9 million in economic output\xe2\x80\x94a 74% increase from 2015. It's a small portion of the city's more than $1 trillion in annual economic activity, but LinkNYC is growing and providing access to the internet for some who might not otherwise get it.\nRelated Articles\nTech industry joins lawsuit against Muslim ban\nNY tech takes next step in anti-Trump campaign\n&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bundles Spotify service with digital subscr\xe2\x80\xa6\nIf New York software engineers make so much money, why are they at the bottom o\xe2\x80\xa6\nVerizon could get a $250 million discount on Yahoo after hacks\nSpotify finalizes deal for 4 World Trade Center space\nABC sells out ad time for the Oscars\nNew York to require banks and insurers to step up cybersecurity\nYahoo salvages Verizon deal with $350 million discount\nGet rid of those Wi-Fi kiosks\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain's New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain's Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

Now, visitors must have their own devices to access the free WiFi.\nLinkNYC has generated $37.3 million in advertising revenue since they launched and they\xe2\x80\x99re expected to generate $25 million in the upcoming year, according to DoITT Commissioner Anne M. Roest, who testified at Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing.\nrecommended reading\nOfficial: Porn viewers are hogging free web kiosks\nVacca is optimistic that the service will straighten itself out after a first-year rife with difficulties.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going back,\xe2\x80\x9d Vacca said after the hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned from the experience when the city initially rolled it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSome New Yorkers and civil rights groups such as the NYCLU expressed concern over users\xe2\x80\x99 data mining and privacy issues. Two weeks ago, CityBridge updated its privacy policy and sought to ensure users that the kiosks don\xe2\x80\x99t store or share personal information.\nLast September, the city disabled the use of the stations\xe2\x80\x99 web browsers after fielding a number of complaints about people monopolizing the kiosks and spending hours surfing the internet, often for inappropriate material.\nIrene Meisel, a member of the group RethinkLinkNYC who attended the City Council hearing, argued that the kiosks do not go far enough to achieve their primary goal, as stated by city officials: to close the \xe2\x80\x9cdigital divide\xe2\x80\x9d faced by low-income New Yorkers without web access at home.\nMeisel said her group would like to see the city direct some of the LinkNYC revenue to programs that increase digital access to underserved communities.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe city has said that the Links were put up to address the digital divide.

LinkNYC\nNew York City's Wi-Fi Kiosks Now Include a 'Yelp for Social Services'\nLaura Bliss\nApr 13, 2017\nThe move targets New Yorkers who stand to benefit most from the LinkNYC network in the first place. Share Tweet LinkedInEmailPrint\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no blueprint for how to roll out the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest free public wi-fi network\xe2\x80\x94especially one with hundreds of web-beaming, touch-screen towers spread across five boroughs. So a little more than a year after LinkNYC installed its first kiosks around New York City, some questions are still hazy. How are they supposed to be used? Who are they really meant for?\nToday LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s purpose takes a slightly clearer shape, with the addition of Aunt Bertha, an existing app modeled as a Yelp for social safety-net services run by an Austin-based benefit corporation. LinkNYC kiosks are already equipped with access to 911 and 311, a portal to apply for government benefits, interactive maps, free phone-call capabilities, and a USB charger. Through a simple search from one of the kiosk tablets, New Yorkers can now tap into Aunt Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s robust database of food pantries, emergency housing, childcare, healthcare, transportation assistance, and financial aid programs located within that zip code.\nRecommended\nTo Court a Skeptical Public, New York Sends Wi-Fi Ambassadors\nEillie Anzilotti Aug 12, 2016\nA Portland Startup Is Smashing Barriers to Affordable Housing Laura Bliss Jan 27, 2017\nA Brazilian Vision Blooms Anew in the Bronx Amanda Kolson Hurley Jun 21, 2019\nThe app targets the New Yorkers who stand the most to gain from LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s services in the first place. A 2015 study by the city comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office found that roughly 813,000 households (nearly 26 percent, citywide) lacked broadband access at home; 510,000 don\xe2\x80\x99t have a computer.\nThe majority of these disconnected households are surviving below the poverty line, and may benefit from the resources Aunt Bertha is designed to catalogue and serve up with ease. Founded in 2012, the platform has connected more than 280,000 people around the U.S. with services from all tiers of government, large nonprofit agencies, and neighborhood groups\xe2\x80\x94the sorts of resources otherwise buried across thousands of websites and pamphlets that can require hours or days of sifting to find.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople in need are almost always grappling with interrelated problems\xe2\x80\xa6 so easily accessible powerful technology tools that provide useful options in one place are key,\xe2\x80\x9d Steve Lee, a managing director at Robin Hood, a New York City anti-poverty agency, said in a statement.\nWhether New Yorkers will bite, of course, is the big-ticket question. LinkNYC has logged more than a million registered users on its wi-fi network since the kiosks first rolled out in February 2016. However, the offerings have shifted substantially: Initially, the touch-screens offered unfettered web-browsing, but that feature quickly got axed when the lure of YouTube (and porn sites) proved too disruptive to sidewalk life. And not all New Yorkers have taken enthusiastically to the 2001 Space Odyssey-like monoliths, which are owned and operated by a consortium of public and private entities with Alphabet at the center. Data privacy concerns, especially in low-income neighborhoods already experiencing disproportionate levels of police surveillance, have held plenty of users back.\nRepresentatives for LinkNYC say that the kiosks themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t require log-ins (though the wi-fi network does), and wipe any personal information entered at the end of each session. Usage data from the Aunt Bertha app, they say, will be aggregated to guide searchers to services that might be the most in-demand where they are. LinkNYC also continues to work with community groups, local libraries, youth groups, and seniors organizations to reach groups that could benefit from the services. Meanwhile, the network will continue to expand. Currently, there are a little over 800 kiosks around the city; LinkNYC expects 7,500 total by 2025.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart\xe2\x80\x9d technology will never solve wicked problems like urban poverty, hunger, transportation gaps, and healthcare divides on its own\xe2\x80\x94focused policies and targeted investments have to work in tandem. But if the yank-back of LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s web browsing access was a case study in unintended consequences of overly broad ambitions, a move to connect more New Yorkers with specific services is a step in a helpful direction.\nAbout the Author\nLaura Bliss\n@mslaurabliss\nFeed Laura Bliss is CityLab\xe2\x80\x99s west coast bureau chief.

When that sum is unaffordable, defendants might spend months in jail, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re accused of non-violent, low-level crimes. One man who stole toothpaste and breath mints spent\xc2\xa0308 days in jail. A pregnant woman who stole candy bars and plums spent 135 days in jail. For someone working a low-wage job, even a day or two of missed work might mean losing employment.advertisementadvertisement\xe2\x80\x9cCan physically altering a space change the narrative for a criminal justice system?\xe2\x80\x9d [Image: Cannon Design]Judges currently make these potentially life-changing rulings inside a noisy, distracting, chaotic courtroom. Designers at CannonDesign saw improving the physical environment as one step toward fairer decisions, by allowing judges to give full attention to a defendant and clearly communicate.\xe2\x80\x9cWe immediately jumped at the notion: can physically altering a space, can the inclusion of design, change the narrative for a criminal justice system that has a couple of different spotlights on it right now?\xe2\x80\x9d says Timothy Swanson, who leads the city design practice at the Chicago office of CannonDesign.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for designers to work on these type of government challenges because our creative work can lead to valuable change.\xe2\x80\x9d [Image: Cannon Design]The CannonDesign team, working with the court system and the local Civic Consulting Alliance, spent the summer and part of the fall of 2016 observing bond court proceedings before coming up with a plan that improves acoustics, minimizes distracting movement, aligns parties with the judge, and features signage that clearly explains the bond ruling process to family members waiting in the corridor outside. The new courtroom, which won the urban design award in the 2017 World Changing Idea awards, is set to open this spring. (You can read about the rest of the finalists below.)\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for designers to work on these type of government challenges because our creative work can lead to valuable change,\xe2\x80\x9d Swanson says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s equally important for designers to be engaged in these challenges from the outset. Often, when government agencies receive money, they need to spend it quickly and thus they may be forced to make the easiest changes in the least amount of time. However, if these agencies have engaged with designers about the challenges previously, they\xe2\x80\x99re ready with a road map to act on when they do receive funding. This is key to success.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThis can make an immediate, localized impact and it can hopefully catalyze even greater systematic improvements in the justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d [Image: Cannon Design]After the bond court redesign, the designers hope to work on other courtrooms. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the bond court is truly the entry point for most into the judicial system, we believe there\xe2\x80\x99s also strong opportunity for this to improve fairness throughout a city\xe2\x80\x99s justice system and/or the national system\xe2\x80\x93but we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to build on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have people entering bond courts designed for equity and then advancing through the system into other courtrooms that don\xe2\x80\x99t value their dignity. So, this can make an immediate, localized impact and it can hopefully catalyze even greater systematic improvements in the justice system.\xe2\x80\x9dHere\xe2\x80\x99s more about the finalists in the urban design category:advertisementBorder CityFR-EEWhile Trump plans a border wall that could cost more than $20 billion, Mexican architect Fernando Romero proposes building a border city instead.

For example, don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the trap of thinking that roaming is now free wherever you are in Europe.Some operators have extended roaming at no extra cost beyond EU countries \xe2\x80\x93 for example, with Vodafone to the Channel Islands, Albania, Switzerland and Turkey. However, with EE, O2 and Three, you still have to pay high fees to roam in Turkey.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nPrevious 1 Next\nBob along to Bodrum: Tourists are shying away from Turkey -...\nLondon to France on a PRIVATE PLANE for \xc2\xa361? New Uber-like...\nShare this article\nShare\nOperators are also allowed to impose \xe2\x80\x98fair use\xe2\x80\x99 restrictions for data usage where domestic plans include unlimited data, and charge if you exceed their limits.But while some operators have decided to set such a limit \xe2\x80\x93 with Three for a contract customer it is 12GB a month \xe2\x80\x93 not all are following suit, so check with your provider.Beyond those European countries where roaming charges have been abolished, staying connected when travelling can still be very expensive.\nSome operators have extended roaming at no extra cost beyond EU countries \xe2\x80\x93 for example, with Vodafone to Turkey (pictured). With EE, O2 and Three, though, this is not the caseWith O2, for example, the standard rate for pay-monthly customers in popular holiday destinations such as Barbados, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates is \xc2\xa31.50 a minute to make a call, \xc2\xa31.25 a minute to receive a call, 40p to send a text and \xc2\xa36 to use 1MB of data (1MB is a tiny amount \xe2\x80\x93 downloading a song typically uses at least 3MB).Moreover, from next month roaming charges outside the EU will be subject to 20 per cent VAT, so unless operators absorb the tax rise, rates may shoot up.But there are ways to avoid, or at least minimise, roaming costs outside the EU\xe2\x80\xa6Use Three\xc2\xa0Its Feel At Home arrangement, which lets customers roam using their UK call, text and data allowances, covers a number of major long-haul holiday destinations. These include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka, and Brazil and Singapore have just been added to the list.Just bear in mind that in these countries you still have to pay extra for calls to local numbers made within the destination you\xe2\x80\x99re visiting \xe2\x80\x93 such as making a reservation with a New York restaurant while you are in the Big Apple.Sign up for an add-on roaming package with other operatorsIt is likely to work out far cheaper than roaming on their standard rates. For example, the O2 Travel add-on, which pay-monthly customers can use in dozens of countries outside its Europe Zone, gives unlimited data, 120 minutes for calls and 120 texts for \xc2\xa34.99 a day.Use free wi-fiI cannot think of a hotel or self-catering rental I\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed at abroad in the past year which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t offered some free internet access. And a growing number of cities are offering free wi-fi hotspots, such as New York (see link.nyc).Even in EU countries where data roaming now costs nothing extra, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to use wi-fi so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t eat up any data allowances.You can track down free-access hotspots around the world on a wi-fi app (wifimap.io), and Facebook has also just started rolling out a feature for locating free wi-fi.With free wi-fi, you can make voice or video calls with family and friends on internet-enabled services such as Skype, WhatsApp and Apple\xe2\x80\x99s FaceTime without costing a penny.

What if there were digital screens mounted on street corners that warned you the subway was running late and directed you to other forms of transportation? And what if those screens also notified you of community events, listed daily pollution levels, and solicited your opinion on local government initiatives?Such a scenario may soon be reality in London and New York. Both cities are replacing outdated phone booths with Wi-Fi kiosks that have embedded computing tablets, USB charging ports, keypads for making phone calls, and large screens that display relevant information to passersby. New York, which started installing its \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x9d kiosks in 2016, currently has more than 900 activated across all five boroughs and plans to increase that number to 7,500. The U.K.\xc2\xa0just started erecting its \xe2\x80\x9cInLinkUK\xe2\x80\x9d kiosks in London and\xc2\xa0intends to deploy up to 1,000 across the country.Today, people use the Links primarily to charge their smartphones, take advantage of the fast Wi-Fi, make Internet (VoIP) calls, and search for information about the weather and local restaurants. All these services are free to use, in part because the 10-foot-tall kiosks display ads that generate funds the cities share with the companies that designed and run the technology. These companies, which include Qualcomm and the telecom giant BT, pay for the Links\xe2\x80\x99 installation and maintenance costs. They have estimated that the city of New York will earn more than half a billion dollars in revenue over 12 years from the LinkNYC partnership.A LinkNYC Wi-Fi kiosk on the street. Intersection runs more than 900 of these across New York City.Link is poised to be far more than an advertising and Wi-Fi network, however. Intersection, the company that manages the Link projects in London and New York, is considering upgrading them to support everything from augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cPhase One was about making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re offering robust services to people,\xe2\x80\x9d says Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s chief innovation officer, Colin O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re figuring out how we can leverage all the different data sets we have access to and make [this technology] as dynamic and responsive as it can be.\xe2\x80\x9dIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions bear attention because it is one of the few private firms that large cities have partnered with on high-profile public-information projects\xe2\x80\x94and its digital technology is likely to spread to other major U.S. cities, such as Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, where it holds multiyear municipal and transit advertising contracts. (That\xe2\x80\x99s true despite public concern last year that some people were using the LinkNYC kiosks to watch inappropriate videos and blast music. Intersection says it disabled the Internet browser on the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 tablets in September 2016 and has received very few complaints since.)Sign up for The Download \xe2\x80\x94 your daily dose of what's up in emerging technologyAlso stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events?YesNoIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the future may also suggest ways that Google parent Alphabet hopes to shape cities through its \xe2\x80\x9curban innovation\xe2\x80\x9d subsidiary, Sidewalk Labs. Sidewalk Labs is an investor in Intersection, its CEO is the chairman of Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors, and the companies share the same Manhattan office. O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell declined to comment on his company\xe2\x80\x99s association with Alphabet beyond saying that he collaborates frequently with Sidewalk Labs on smart-city ideas, with Intersection tackling the more immediate work and Sidewalk Labs focusing on projects that are five or more years out. But it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see how the companies could sync up on future initiatives.Since Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s LinkNYC and InLinkUK contracts both run for at least 10 years, O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell has been brainstorming new features that would make the kiosks more useful. For example, the Links could be outfitted with environmental sensors. Intersection worked with Argonne National Laboratory to develop sensors that detect about 30 different pollutants and could negotiate with its city partners to add them to the kiosks.Intersection also manages 185 information kiosks inside the New York City subway.Each Link also has two built-in cameras, which face in opposite directions, potentially yielding views up and down the street. Right now, these cameras are only used to monitor for vandalism and damage, but if the city granted permission, Intersection could use them to capture a nearly 360\xc2\xb0 view of each Link\xe2\x80\x99s surroundings. (Intersection says it does not store video for longer than seven days, unless the footage is necessary to investigate an incident. The company also says it does not use facial recognition technology or track people\xe2\x80\x99s movement through the city.) Eventually, information from Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s future sensors could be combined to create real-time data maps that might be useful for emerging technologies such as self-driving cars.Joseph Chow, an assistant professor of civil and urban engineering at New York University, likes the idea of Intersection using its kiosks as city sensors. He thinks future Links could help facilitate a Department of Transportation project that is researching ways to use roadside infrastructure to communicate information about accidents to cars and other vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cThese technologies provide the architecture that smart cities need to operate,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chow. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you use them to collect information about how people are traveling and to detect disruptions, you can react to situations faster and make better decisions.\xe2\x80\x9dNext, Intersection is looking to deploy its digital screens in airports, apartment buildings, and office complexes. O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell says the company has spent \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of hours\xe2\x80\x9d in airports studying ways that connected displays could guide people from arrival through the security process and to their gates. Intersection has also worked with real estate developers, including New York\xe2\x80\x93based Related Companies, to streamline the way people enter and navigate buildings, move through security, and learn about tenant news and events. Its ultimate goal, says O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, is to build a \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic digital infrastructure across the entire city experience.\xe2\x80\x9dShareLinkTaggedSmart CitiesAuthorElizabeth WoykePopular01.The future of AI research is in Africa02.The Crab Nebula just blasted Earth with the highest-energy photons ever recorded03.Carbon farming is the hot (and overhyped) tool to fight climate changePopular01.The future of AI research is in Africa02.The Crab Nebula just blasted Earth with the highest-energy photons ever recorded03.Carbon farming is the hot (and overhyped) tool to fight climate changeFrom our advertisersIn association with IntelSelf-driving cars take the wheelIn association with IntelGetting smart about the future of AI IntelAutonomous driving: Safety firstProduced in association with IBMOptimizing the engineering life cycle requires digital transformationAdvertisementTopicsArtificial IntelligenceBiotechnologyBlockchainClimate ChangeComputingCyborgsEthical TechSilicon ValleySmart CitiesSpaceFollowSubscribe", b'LinkNYC kiosks showcase southeast Queens artists -

It\xe2\x80\x99s so fun to see them engage with our brand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Delgado of Yvelisse Salon.\nThe kiosks started to include monthlong art exhibits by local artists Oct. 14, Mays said.\nHe was inspired to feature artwork by area artists in public spaces after seeing the same mural work by the Jamaica Center Parsons/Archer station for years and he wanted to do something fresh.\nAt first he reached out to the Metropolitan Transit Authority to feature artwork in the light boxes within the station that had old podiatrist ads, but Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, a different art organization in the area had artwork put up in the station.\nAfter a year of conceiving this project, Mays got in touch with Melva Miller, the deputy borough president, who put him in touch with LinkNYC.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to displace what JCAL was doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mays, \xe2\x80\x9cso I reached out to the LinkNYC people.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe first artist to have his artwork displayed on the kiosks is Emmett Wigglesworth, 83.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was excited when I heard they were going to feature artists on the kiosks,\xe2\x80\x9d Wigglesworth said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been an artist all my life and I enjoy doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWigglesworth became a professional artist in 1957 after finishing his service with the Marine Corps during the Korean War and has lived in the Jamaica area since.\nHis artwork falls in the fauvism style, which emphasizes strong color over realistic representation of people or objects. Some of Wigglesworth art on the kiosks features people playing jazz music on saxophones. Southeast Queens use to be home to many jazz musicians like John Coltrane, who lived in St. Albans.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the news about southeast Queens is about the foreclosures going on, but he knew it\xe2\x80\x99s much more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mays said.\nThere are 10 pieces of Wigglesworth art featured on 18 kiosks on Jamaica Avenue from Sutphin Boulevard to 168th Street, which will be there until the end of October.\nReach reporter Naeisha Rose by e-mail at nrose@cnglocal.com or by phone at (718) 260\xe2\x80\x934573.\nTopics:\nart\nGreg Mays\nShare this story\nFacebookTwitteremail\nRelated Stories\nArtisanal craft program coming to St. Albans\nFilm program teaches black history through art\nPopular Stories\nFlushing man wins $5,000,000 on \'Set for Life\' scratch-off ticket\nThief drugged man\'s drink and stole his valuables while he slept in Queens home: cops\nLong Island City strip mall to get BJ\xe2\x80\x99s and Burlington Coat Factory\nAbout Schneps Communications, 2018\nMasthead\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nQUEENS COURIER\nRIDGEWOOD TIMES\nBORO MAGAZINE\nLIC MAGAZINE\nSend Invite\n\xc3\x97\nSubject: Subject line is fixed\nAn invitation to join the QNS community.\n(optional) Customize the text of the\ninvitation.\nThe message will also contain a custom footer containing links to accept\nthe invitation or opt out of further email invitations from this site.\nYou have been invited by Queens Courier Staff to join the QNS community.\nVisit Queens Courier Staff\'s profile at qns.com/members/admin/.\n\xc3\x97\nCreate an Account\nForgot Password\nor\nLog in with\nCreate New Event\n\xc3\x97\nx\nUpload\nImproper image submitted.

The stations were placed around the city near transit stops and businesses, replacing old telephone booths.\nBusiness owners with kiosks in front of their stores in Jamaica have been using the advertising capabilities of LinkNYC to boost customer traffic and profits since their release.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are excited to work with the Jamaica BID and local small businesses to give them the opportunity to advertise on Links,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth Fasoldt, the community affairs manager for LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cLocal ads run on two 55-inch digital displays on the Link closest to each business. Over 15 businesses along Jamaica Ave have participated thus far and we have gotten great feedback.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNYC Wi-Fi can bring free services like phone calls and wireless web access to the city because of its paid advertising program. Its latest efforts citywide allow for business owners to advertise on booths closer to their area.\nValerie Stevens, the director of business services at the Jamaica Center Business Improvement District, says she\xe2\x80\x99s seen an increase in walk-ins at individually owned businesses and a change in aesthetics on Jamaica Avenue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s great to have it here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stevens. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great marketing tool for the businesses on Jamaica Avenue. It promotes the avenue in a way that says this is marketable, there is revenue and businesses here.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStevens helped multiple stores advertise on the kiosks and gain the attention of larger audiences. In a back-to-school fashion show event hosted by the Jamaica Bid in August, Stevens said, she received a much larger crowd than expected thanks to the advertisements.\nMaria Delgado from Yvelisse Salon talked to LinkNYC about how her profits have increased since the placement of the kiosks.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have recently had an ad (thanks to LinkNYC and JBID for sponsoring us) entered onto the LinkNYC screens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Delgado said in an email to the Chronicle. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had fans of our salon send us photos of our salon being promoted on the LinkNYC screens. It\xe2\x80\x99s so fun to see them engage with our brand!\xe2\x80\x9d\nStevens\xe2\x80\x99 talks with LinkNYC helped generate two months advertising on kiosks across the Jamaica strip for some businesses. Stevens planned to hold another meeting with LinkNYC to expand advertising to other boroughs and create a better package for Jamaica businesses.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think our businesses should be offered a reasonable fee to promote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stevens. \xe2\x80\x9cThe businesses really liked seeing their brand on the machines. Our businesses should be given first choice to promote because they will be making money within the district.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMayor de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s office announced the choice of CityBridge as the 12-year franchise agreement winner to orchestrate the LinkNYC program on Nov. 17, 2014. The project was set to replace public pay-phone booths with the latest technology.\nTechnological companies CityBridge, Intersection, Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes coordinated to make the kiosk stations user-friendly with a touch screen pad and slim design.\nAntenna Design, the tech company responsible for the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 structure, made them to withstand the extreme weather conditions of New York like floods and snowstorms, and even earthquakes, according to LinkNYC.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are more than 1,100 active Links in all five boroughs and thousands more are coming over the next few years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fasoldt. \xe2\x80\x9cEach Link offers superfast Wi-Fi, phone calls, a 911 button and other services completely for free. Working with neighborhood businesses is a key part of our mission to make Link an integral part of the communities we deploy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNearly 163 Links are placed around Queens on bus, train and traffic routes. That means almost 12 percent of kiosks in the city are in Queens.\nAlong Jamaica Avenue between 76th and 168th streets, there are 51 kiosks, according to the LinkNYC website map.\nQueens Boulevard holds the most in the borough between 78th Avenue and Van Dam Street with 54. Roosevelt Avenue falls in second with 35 booths between 72nd and Warren streets. Broadway between Corona Avenue and 75th Street holds 31 kiosks with other areas in the single digits.\nA representative from Make Me Over Beauty Bar on Jamaica Avenue and Merrick Boulevard talked to LinkNYC about how they encourage customers to use the Links.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe recommend LinkNYC to our customers daily when they ask for free Wi-Fi service,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said, in an email sent to the Chronicle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe comfort of the nearby kiosk provides free Wi-Fi to our customers sitting in the waiting area.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMore about Economy\nARTICLE: Hotels for sale spark shelter concerns\n$92.8 billion budget approved for city 1\nARTICLE: $92.8 billion budget approved for city\nCrossing all the Ts for Bartlett Dairy 1\nARTICLE: Crossing all the Ts for Bartlett Dairy\nDiscuss\nPrint\nPosted in\nQueenswide,\nSouth Queens News,\nEastern/Southeast Queens News,\nCentral/Mid Queens News,\nNorth/Northeast Queens News,\nWestern Queens News\non\nThursday, November 9, 2017 10:30 am.\n| Tags:\nEconomy\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nSign Up\n1 comment:\nVBarbour\nposted at 2:11 pm on Fri, Nov 10, 2017.\nPosts: 50\nFour years ago at a Participatory Budgeting (PB) session being held in NYC Council District 32 sponsored by the WRBA residents attending the event suggested that NYC provide WiFi for the businesses along the Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven.\nWhen the suggestion was reviewed by City agencies we were told that the infrastructure would be too expensive and that the service could not be provided under PB rules.\nWe suggested it would still be a good idea.Now we find that 12 LinkNYC kiosks have been erected on Jamaica Avenue and that the public-private partnership between NYC and Alphabet (Google's parent) is generating $500 million in advertising revenue.\nSo what couldn't be done before can now magically be done when it generates revenue for The City.\nWhat I was expecting this article to address was that local business cannot afford the $5K it costs to advertise for 4 weeks on the LinkNYC kiosk and that local businesses still do not have free or low cost internet access to help generate business, create jobs and add tax revenue to NYC coffers.Maybe a follow-up story is in order?\nLink\nPrint comments\nSubmit your news!\nSubmit your news!

The company is aiming for a total of 7,500 Links by 2026.CreditCreditCole Wilson for The New York TimesBy Keith WilliamsJan. 11, 2018Q. Tall kiosks labeled \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC\xe2\x80\x9d are replacing phone booths, offering free Wi-Fi and nationwide phone calls. The thing is, I have never seen anybody using one. What gives?A. Compared with the pay phones they often replace, LinkNYC kiosks, known as Links, get plenty of use, even if no one is standing next to them.According to CityBridge, the consortium that operates LinkNYC, over 3.2 million people have registered for the system\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi service, with 600,000 users each week. The Wi-Fi operates at gigabit speed, meaning it can be up to 100 times faster than cellular LTE networks. The range of a Link is about 150 feet in any direction.Links are a critical piece in the city\xe2\x80\x99s goal to bring broadband internet access to all New Yorkers, but the system\xe2\x80\x99s community-first approach provides other social benefits, as well.Each Link has an interactive screen, which offers everyday information you might expect, like weather, local maps, and transit updates, as well as a connection to the city\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service. Through a partnership with the software program Aunt Bertha, however, users can anonymously search for nonprofit and social services.Links also offer free phone calls anywhere in the country; the system registers around 200,000 calls each month. The number dialed most frequently? The state\xe2\x80\x99s hotline for its Electronic Benefits Transfer program, commonly known as food stamps.Since the system launched in early 2016, around 1,250 Links have been erected throughout all five boroughs. The company is aiming for a total of 7,500 Links by 2026, when its contract with the city is scheduled to expire.As the first system of its kind, LinkNYC has faced unforeseen difficulties. When the system was introduced, each Link offered an internet browser. But a slew of complaints of users camping out in front of the units and, in some cases, viewing inappropriate content, caused the system to remove that functionality.The system\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge is finding new locations, said Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC. The system is building a new fiber-optic network, but not every pay phone site is close enough to a manhole to connect to it.Links generate revenue through advertisements, which appear on the 55-inch screens on the sides of each kiosk. These ads are interspersed with in-house content like \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and historical photos of nearby locations. LinkNYC and the city split the ad revenue equally, subject to an annual minimum.The idea is expanding to other cities: Links have begun appearing in the United Kingdom, and are set to arrive in Philadelphia this summer.The system is in a constant state of refinement, with temporary options ranging from time-sensitive to whimsical. Through Jan. 31, for example, users can browse and enroll in health care plans; in December, each Link offered a direct line to Santa\xe2\x80\x99s voice mail.EMAIL fyi@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on , on Page MB3 of the New York edition.

Images will be displayed from the Museum\xe2\x80\x99s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs.\nPasserby on the street will be able to catch a glimpse of the old New York through the lens of the iconic film director. Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s photographs highlight his formative years as a photographer (before he became a film director) for Look magazine in New York City between 1945-1950. The photographs focus on and capture the pathos of everyday life of the city, from street scenes to sporting events.\nThe LinkNYC kiosks can be found dotted all over the city. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the program in 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs and have replaced the old pay phones with sleek kiosks that feature free Wi-Fi, phone chargers, and digital displays for advertisements and in this case, art.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that LinkNYC has featured art on its kiosks from MCNY. Previous \xe2\x80\x9cexhibitions\xe2\x80\x9d on the kiosks include historic photos of women who influenced New York\xe2\x80\x99s political history for Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month and \xe2\x80\x9cOn This Day in NYC History\xe2\x80\x9d information. The MCNY and LinkNYC partnership is one of many programs that disseminate New York City\xe2\x80\x99s history; others include the NYC Space/Time Directory from the New York Public Library, an app from Urban Archive that made more than 2,500 images of old New York available on-the-go, and a Civil Rights & Social Justice Map from the Greenwich Village Society.\nLinkNYC\nMCNY\nPublic Art\nRelated Stories\nJune 21, 2019\nOur (Enclosed) Town\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nJune 6, 2019\nDisaster Dioramas\nArtist Josh Kline brings climate change home in a new Manhattan show\nJune 3, 2019\nCarpet Diem\nMiniature undulating cityscape comes to Madison Square Park\nMay 21, 2019\nSO-IL Meets Soil\nSO-IL and West 8 team up for an Artpark outside Buffalo, New York\nTrending\nMost Popular\nMost Recent\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nNational Trust for Historic Preservation names 2019\xe2\x80\x99s most endangered places\nDS+R and Rockwell Group\xe2\x80\x99s The Shed opens its massive guillotine doors\nJunya Ishigami reveals completed Serpentine Pavilion\nKnight Foundation announces its first class of Public Spaces Fellows\nConstruction begins on massive Machu Picchu airport despite protests\nTWA Hotel opens in JFK Airport\xe2\x80\x99s Eero Saarinen\xe2\x80\x93designed landmark\nFrench Senate declares Notre Dame must be rebuilt as it was before, quashing competition\nFrank Lloyd Wright cabin outside of Chicago faces demolition\nDetroit picks team to shape Midtown cultural center\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nSeattle makes affordable housing mandatory in upzoned neighborhoods\nHarvard\xe2\x80\x99s HouseZero is a live-in lab for sustainable renovation\nThomas Kelley reviews Virgil Abloh\xe2\x80\x99s mid-career retrospective\nCopyright 2019The Architect's Newspaper, LLCAll rights reserved.\nRegions\nInternational\nEast\nSoutheast\nMidwest\nWest\nSouthwest\nTopics\nAN Interior\nArchitecture\nArt\nDesign\nDevelopment\nPreservation\nTransportation\nUrbanism\nNewsletters\nFacades+\nSpec Sheet\nCity Terrain\nLate Edition: East\nLate Edition: West\nLate Edition: Midwest\nLate Edition: Southwest\nConferences\nFacades+ Conference\nFacades+ AM\nTech+\nInformation\nAwards\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nMap\nThe Architect's Newspaper, LLC | 21 Murray Street, 5th Floor | New York, NY 10007 | tel. 212.966.0630\nCopyright 2019, All rights reserved.", b"LinkNYC kiosks showcase work by locals during National Poetry Month | am New York\nMenu\nLATEST PAPER\nSEARCH\nNews\nPolitics\nThings To Do\nEAT & DRINK\nEntertainment\nReal Estate\nTransit\nOpinion\nLATEST PAPER\n79\xc2\xb0\n6/23/2019\nGood Afternoon\nSEARCH\nHome\nNews\nPolitics\nElections\nThings To Do\nEat & Drink\nEntertainment\nCelebrities\nPets\nSecrets of NY\nReal Estate\nCity Living\nBrooklyn\nManhattan\nQueens\nStaten Island\nTransit\nSports\nOpinion\nJim Marguiles\nCartoon roundup\nWeather\n79\xc2\xb0\n6/23/2019\nGood Afternoon\nNews\nLinkNYC kiosks showcase work by locals during National Poetry Month\nPoems were composed by those with HIV/AIDS and other conditions.\nLinkNYC kiosks are displaying work by Alliance for Positive Change's clients for\nNational Poetry Month.\nPhoto Credit: Alliance for Positive Change\nBy Lisa L.

Writing helped Velez deal with her deep depression and grief after her partner passed away while waiting for a liver transplant.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted a place where I could express what I was feeling but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really sure what I was feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was hurt and angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGet Breaking News emails\nThe latest about your city, as it happens.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nHer writing group turned into a second family. And she now strives to share that support with other clients who might be intimidated by the idea of writing poetry.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe tell them to write from the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said, adding that she leaves each session with a feeling of hope.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt inspires me to come back and teach the class,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nDuke said the writing groups, which meet weekly, have been held more than 800 times since starting in 2000 and have collectively created thousands of poems.\nShe reached out to her friend, Gerry Gomez Pearlberg, a writer and poet, to help design the class. Pearlberg trained students, such as Velez, to be leaders and carry the program forward.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe respected the way we were feeling and always made us feel comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told us to write whatever we were feeling that day and it was OK.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince some of the sensitive subject matter that comes up in discussions and in writing includes violence, abuse, rape and substance abuse, confidentiality is key, Velez said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you say in the class stays in the class,\xe2\x80\x9d Velez said.\nExplaining the program to funders has sometimes been a challenge because they question how it can help with HIV prevention and other health issues, Duke said. But she is able to share examples of the program\xe2\x80\x99s positive impacts, for instance, one client proudly told Duke he spent his last dollar laminating his poem rather than purchasing a beer.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a person feels respected, feels heard, feels good about themselves, they will be in a better place to take care of themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Duke said.\nBy Lisa L.

Along the way, Villegas scopes out the silver LinkNYC kiosks. These 10-foot-tall, silver monoliths have replaced sidewalk payphones in more than 1,300 locations throughout the five boroughs. The kiosks provide free WiFi and calling functions and allow users to charge their phones.\nRelated Stories\nBridging Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Divide Has Community MeaningPublic Service Design Brings Fresh Eyes to Old ProblemsNew York City to Subsidize MetroCards for Low-Income ResidentsNew York Lawmakers Making More Moves Against Tenant Harassment\nVillegas looks to the gleaming, 55-inch screens on either side of the kiosks, seeking new additions to a series of numbered New York City facts, rotating among the paid advertisements, event listings, weather updates and transit alerts. If Villegas, 44, comes across a fact that strikes his fancy, he posts a picture of it on Instagram.\nHis family and friends back in Florida, where he lived before moving to the city in June, now know that there is a superhero supply store in Brooklyn (fact number 139), that New York City gets 15 times more snow than the South Pole each year (fact number 206) and that Martin Hildebrandt opened the United States\xe2\x80\x99 first tattoo business in New York City in 1870 (fact number 304).\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are just things that stop you in your tracks and you go, huh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d Villegas says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to not just see someone selling me a phone plan or a movie trailer. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see just facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the intention of Amanda Giddon, the woman behind the facts. Giddon works at Intersection, the company that manages the LinkNYC kiosks (soon to expand the network to Philadelphia). In addition to their primary functions, the kiosks host advertising and more than 50 other content campaigns, such as news headlines, information on how to sign up for health insurance, a series of comics, and the facts. The ads are on track to generate half a billion dollars in revenue over the next 12 years \xe2\x80\x94 enough to cover the cost of the LinkNYC kiosk services.\nGiddon, 24, grew up in the New York suburbs, and still remembers the sense of awe she felt every time she rode the train thirty minutes into the city \xe2\x80\x94 a feeling she still experiences.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough this work, I\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely re-connected with the city in a new way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her interest in historical New York led her to recently pick up Jennifer Egan\xe2\x80\x99s novel \xe2\x80\x9cManhattan Beach.\xe2\x80\x9d She is eager to try Enoteca Maria, an Italian restaurant in Staten Island that features the cooking of a different grandmother each night. She heard about the restaurant during her fact research.\nGiddon kicked off the NYC Facts campaign in early 2017, right when she started at Intersection. Before then, she\xe2\x80\x99d been working in digital media for almost two years, after graduating from Duke University in 2015.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goal with this campaign is to really make New Yorkers feel like tourists and tourists like New Yorkers,\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe strategy is making [LinkNYC kiosks] a beloved member of the community and making life more enjoyable as people navigate the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs of this writing, Giddon has curated 349 facts and rolls out new ones on a weekly basis. The Intersection communications team gives the facts a quick review before the they go live. What makes a good fact? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that can surprise and delight even the most seasoned New Yorker who\xe2\x80\x99s lived decades in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d says Giddon, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd also can arm consumers with things they want to share with their friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt can be a challenge, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to surprise long-time New Yorkers. Giddon spends a few hours a week fact-hunting, which gives her an opportunity to follow her curiosity. From perusing Broadway.org, she learned that only five of the 40 Broadway theaters are actually on Broadway. According to data from Grow NYC, Greenmarket farmers travel an average of 90 miles between their farm and the city. She found that New Yorkers bite 10 times more people than sharks do worldwide while reading a Time magazine article. When FiveThirtyEight published a report on elevators in New York, the fact that 18 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s adult population could be riding in elevators at a time caught Giddon\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\nA partnership with the National History Museum\xe2\x80\x99s StarTalk Radio resulted in a series of celestial-themed facts. Giddon also worked with the Department of Records to create a series of historical photos displayed on kiosks in the neighborhoods where the photos were originally taken. Her plan to attend the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March inspired a group of facts about women\xe2\x80\x99s history and the suffrage movement in New York, all on display during the event.\nGiddon keeps track of her facts on a spreadsheet and estimates that about two-thirds of the facts in her collection haven\xe2\x80\x99t been published. Sometimes coworkers and friends will suggest facts to include, but Giddon must verify the facts before publishing them. Giddon finds the facts about firsts, such as the origins of the first cappuccino or Manhattan cocktail, to be the most difficult to pin down.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople feel so strongly about New York culture and history that I make it my duty to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the right stuff out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon says with a laugh, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf something is wrong, we totally will get called out on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBecome A Next City Member Today\nSign-up for our newsletters\nSign Up\nSamantha Maldonado is\xc2\xa0a multimedia journalist based in New York City.

And starting today through the rest of the month, some of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s most trailblazing female political activists will be honored at LinkNYC kiosks across the city.\nThe initiative is a collaboration between LinkNYC, the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) and the Museum of the City of New York and not only commemorates this year\'s IWD, but also March being Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month.\nThe women featured on the LinkNYC kiosks are included in the museum\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics\xe2\x80\x9d exhibit, which runs through Aug. 5.\nRecommended Slideshows\n40 PicturesPHOTOS: Blues dump Bruins to win Stanley Cup after agonizing 52-year wait40 Pictures\n8 PicturesPHOTOS: This Pakistani waiter looks just like Peter Dinklage8 Pictures\n36 PicturesAll of these celebrities have had their nudes leaked36 PicturesMore picture galleries\n16 PicturesThese photos of Trump and Ivanka will make you deeply uncomfortable\n16 Pictures\n4 PicturesCuba Gooding Jr. charged in Manhattan groping incident, police say4 Pictures\n2 Pictures4 fun things to do in the Lehigh Valley2 Pictures\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month, we are proud to shine a light on prominent women who have positively impacted New York City and the entire nation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jen Hensley, president of LinkNYC. \xe2\x80\x9cUsing Link\xe2\x80\x99s platform of digital displays throughout the five boroughs, we hope New Yorkers and visitors who walk by Links will get a window into the well-known and unsung heroes who have paved the way for women today.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmong those heroes are Alva Belmont, founder of the Political Equality Association in New York, journalist and civic activist Bessye Bearden, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was a drafter of the Declaration of Sentiments, suffrage leader Mabel Lee and Sarah J.S. Tompkins Garnet, who founded the Equal Suffrage League in Brooklyn.\nThe museum\xe2\x80\x99s exhibit features photos, audio materials, garments and more to tell the stories of the city\xe2\x80\x99s female activists, and DoITTT Commissioner Samir Saini hopes that its partnership with LinkNYC \xe2\x80\x9cwill inspire activism among all the people \xe2\x80\x94 male and female \xe2\x80\x94 of our city today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nWhitney Donhauser, president of the Museum of City of New York, called the collaboration a "perfect match" that "will bring the story of women\xe2\x80\x99s activism in New York to life in unprecedented ways and make the inspiring history of \xe2\x80\x98Beyond Suffrage\xe2\x80\x99 accessible for even more New Yorkers, tourists and visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMore than

LinkNYC, meanwhile, gets to showcase new programming and collect data on how audiences on the street interact with the content.\nFrom there, LinkNYC can develop a more tailored pitch for advertisers that might range from the store right beside the kiosk to a national brand looking to do a citywide takeover.\nThe product of a public-private partnership, LinkNYC has an\xc2\xa0ad revenue-sharing arrangement\xc2\xa0with the city that requires it to deliver $500 million during the first 12 years of the agreement. The deal with NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Olympics division will also bring the customized content to digital networks in Chicago and Philadelphia operated by Intersection.\nAccording to Intersection CEO Ari Buchalter, there will be more programming partnerships of this kind.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking to a large number of folks that have unique and engaging content, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s news, entertainment, sports or local stories, so we can test and experiment [and see] what content people want to experience in that setting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we can see what is the best way\xe2\x80\x9d for advertisers to sponsor the content people want to see and develop strategies related to it.\nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s programming also could reintroduce LinkNYC to New Yorkers who know of it chiefly as the Wi-Fi hub that, for a period in 2016, attracted users who watched pornography on its interactive tablet. The company solved that problem by disabling the tablet\xe2\x80\x99s web browser.\nRelated Articles\nHBO surpasses 5 million U.S. online subscribers\nPrince's former manager Londell McMillan explains Jay-Z's beef with him\nDolan, Garden keeping WNBA's Liberty for now\nUnlimited-movie deal could be too good to survive\nSale of Harvey Weinstein's company up in air after lawsuit\nFilm and TV parking workers vote to unionize\nA relaunch for Gothamist, but not for DNAinfo\nView the discussion thread.\nGet our newsletters\nStaying current is easy with Crain's New York news delivered straight to your inbox, free of charge\nEmail Address\nCrain's Student Offer\nWe offer a discounted rate through Student Beans for students with a valid .edu email address.

They will begin showing content on Thursday.IntersectionShareBy Marty Swant|February 6, 2018\nShareOlympics fans in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia will soon have a way to catch up with the 2018 Winter Olympics without looking down at their phones during their commute.Later this week, NBC Olympics will begin showcasing content from\xc2\xa0Pyeongchang, South Korea\xe2\x80\x94videos and visuals such as highlights, summaries, previews, medal counts and athlete bios\xe2\x80\x94on digital displays on streets and in mass transit systems in those three cities. Through a partnership with Intersection, a New York-based smart cities and media company, NBC hopes to broaden its Olympics footprint while reminding people to watch the games on TV or on NBC\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app.According to\xc2\xa0NBC Olympics President Gary Zenkel, the goal is to reach viewers beyond their usual consumption habits. Since there is a 14-hour time difference between the East Coast and South Korea, Zenkel said he hopes it will also provide ongoing content even though the games are half a world away. That means having highlights from the night before during the morning commute in the U.S. to show people what happened while they were still sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a real-time presence of Olympic content that\xe2\x80\x99s accompanying people who are either heading to work or doing what they do as they maneuver the streets of New York, Philly and Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Adweek during an interview from South Korea.Starting Thursday, around 4,000 digital displays will begin showing Olympics content for about three to six minutes every hour. The New York City monoliths stand 9.5 feet tall, and have 55-inch display screens. Zenkel said the goal is to increase the \xe2\x80\x9cappetite\xe2\x80\x9d for Olympics content.The idea came about a couple of months ago after Zenkel noticed the LinkNYC stands around New York. Soon after that, Zenkel ran into Intersection chief revenue officer Marta Martinez and decided to contact her later to learn more about the displays.\xe2\x80\x9cI saw these kiosks popping up on what felt like at least every city block and in some cases corners and was intrigued,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Zenkel said.This is the first major content play for Intersection, which has digital display partnerships with a number of major cities in the U.S. Screens can show all kinds of content, including ads like Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Shark Tank-style show, \xe2\x80\x9cPlanet of the Apps,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as offer free Wi-Fi. Other Intersection markets include Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis and most recently Los Angeles.The Olympics content will be displayed across the 1,300 LinkNYC kiosks in New York; on digital panels and displays in the Chicago Transit Authority system; and on bus shelters, urban panels and other displays in Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s mass transit system and streets.\xe2\x80\x9cIt ties back to our core mission, which is to improve [the] daily life of cities through technology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Intersection CEO Ari Buchalter. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a big part of that is around delivering unique and powerful content experiences in the public space, in particular those that are sort of human-scale, look-up experiences as opposed to the content that people often consume on their mobile phones.\xe2\x80\x9dThe initial plan late last year was to find advertisers among NBC\xe2\x80\x99s existing content sponsors. However, Zenkel said the plan came together just before the games were set to begin, and the two companies decided not to exchange any money\xe2\x80\x94unless they\xe2\x80\x99re able to find an advertiser at the last minute.\xe2\x80\x9cThe Olympics is a uniquely massive event,\xe2\x80\x9d Zenkel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone who walks down the street seeing some great Olympic content is going to say, \xe2\x80\x98Hmm, how did this end up here?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dBuchalter said Intersection is also in talks to bring other types of content to public spaces. That might include news, social media, local info or cultural content. Buchalter said revenue agreements depend on each contract. However, the share with LinkNYC, a joint partnership with New York City, is split in half.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only see an ad, then you eventually become blind to that space,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

Disney and Marvel worked with technology and media company Intersection to create a first of its kind out-of-home campaign that used roughly 1400 screens or 700 LinkNYC kiosks\xe2\x80\x94all of the kiosks below 125th street\xe2\x80\x94to make sure consumers were aware of the film, its showtimes and the closest theater.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s actually an enormous amount of digital displays,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\xc2\xa0Dave Etherington, chief strategy officer at Intersection. \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC itself is the largest employment of digital displays in any city in the world so to be able to take the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of these is pretty significant. The campaign itself was designed to drive awareness as well as ticket sales and theater visits.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The campaign kicked off last Thursday evening between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. with ads that read, \xe2\x80\x9cSee it tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d and featured the Avengers\xe2\x80\x99 logo.

The city replaced older phone booths with these kiosks, which offer free Wi-Fi to the public, as well as advertising and wayfinding.The kiosks also allow customers to make free nationwide calls, or report emergencies. There are now more than 1,600 kiosks in all five boroughs of the city. Digital Signage Today spoke with Ruth Fasoldt, director of community affairs for Link, to see how these devices are transforming the city and improving lives.Q. What are the main features the kiosks offer?A. LinkNYC is the first-of-its-kind communications network replacing the city\'s payphones to build the world\'s fastest and largest free public Wi-Fi network. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the public launch of LinkNYC in early 2016, more than 1,600 Links are active across all five boroughs, with thousands more set to be deployed over the next several years.In addition to free Wi-Fi, Links offer free nationwide phone calls, a dedicated 911 button, device charging, and a tablet to access maps and city services. Link\'s services come at no cost to users or taxpayers because Link generates its own revenue through advertising on the 55-inch digital displays on the sides of kiosks.Q. How do they improve the lives of residents?A. LinkNYC provides so many benefits to New Yorkers and visitors. More than 4 million people \xe2\x80\x94 more than the populations of the cities of Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Dallas\xc2\xa0or San Diego \xe2\x80\x94 have used the free gigabit Wi-Fi service, with tens of thousands of users joining the network each week. The network also sees more than 250,000 free phone calls made every month. Using the tablet, people can access maps and directions on the go.Along with ads that keep LinkNYC\'s services 100 percent free for users and taxpayers, the digital displays feature useful and enriching content, including community board meeting updates, real-time transit and weather information so people can make more informed decisions about their day on the go, PSAs, fun facts about NYC, historic photos\xc2\xa0and more. The screens are also used for emergency messaging, for instance, in an extreme weather event. We see tweets and Instagram posts all the time of people capturing our content and sharing it with others.Q. How does LinkNYC deal with issues such as people loitering by the kiosks or watching inappropriate content in public?A. Back in 2016, there was an issue with some kiosks having long-term users. The LinkNYC tablet is meant to be an on-the-go resource, so the web browser was removed from Link tablets in September 2016, in exchange for curated content on the tablet, and loitering complaints dropped 96 percent immediately.Q. What type of ads do the kiosks display?A. LinkNYC has a very high caliber of advertisers across categories \xe2\x80\x94 from Samsung to Delta to The Gap and The Met.Utilizing DOOH\xc2\xa0to its fullest and breaking from the norm of basic, static ads, Link kiosks offer the ability for advertisers to display unique, dynamic ads. From weather and transit, to sporting events, movie times and more, Link ads can change based on real-time information and updates, keeping advertisements relevant and consumers engaged.During the 2018 Winter Olympics in PeyongChang, for example, NBC partnered with Intersection to display Olympics content and coverage on LinkNYC screens, highlights, prime time previews, real-time medal counts, athlete bios and more. This digital OOH content campaign was the first of its kind for the U.S. Olympics broadcaster.More recently, Intersection pioneered another first-of-its-kind campaign, partnering with Disney and Marvel to promote "The Avengers: Infinity War." On the movie\'s launch weekend, LinkNYC screens displayed ads for the blockbuster, as well as the closest theater location to each kiosk and the next show time, so that passersby, if inspired by the ad, could easily catch the next showing.Q. Do the kiosks use any analytics?A. We have stats on usership, how often different services are used, the busiest Links and more. We have also made strategic use of our network capabilities like dayparting (for example, we increase transit info on our displays during peak commuting hours), geotargeting (playing historical photos in their place of original capture), and network flexibility (during Women\'s History month, we displayed facts about women\'s suffrage along the route of the women\'s march).Q. Do you think smart cities will start to pop up everywhere? Why?A.\xc2\xa0Cities around the world are looking for ways to better deliver services to residents and visitors, increase broadband connectivity, and adapt to the needs of the digital age. Many are looking to New York and LinkNYC in particular as a model. In addition to New York, a Link network is live in the U.K.\xc2\xa0We have planned expansions into Philadelphia and Newark, with many more cities on the way.Image via Link.Topics: Advertising, Audience Measurement, Content, Customer Experience, Display Technology, DOOH Advertising, Outdoor Signage Bradley CooperBradley Cooper is a Technology Editor for DigitalSignageToday.com and BlockchainTechNews.com.

Images will be displayed from the Museum\xe2\x80\x99s current exhibition, Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs.\nPasserby on the street will be able to catch a glimpse of the old New York through the lens of the iconic film director. Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s photographs highlight his formative years as a photographer (before he became a film director) for Look magazine in New York City between 1945-1950. The photographs focus on and capture the pathos of everyday life of the city, from street scenes to sporting events.\nThe LinkNYC kiosks can be found dotted all over the city. Since Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the program in 2016, more than 1,650 Links are active across all five boroughs and have replaced the old pay phones with sleek kiosks that feature free Wi-Fi, phone chargers, and digital displays for advertisements and in this case, art.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that LinkNYC has featured art on its kiosks from MCNY. Previous \xe2\x80\x9cexhibitions\xe2\x80\x9d on the kiosks include historic photos of women who influenced New York\xe2\x80\x99s political history for Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month and \xe2\x80\x9cOn This Day in NYC History\xe2\x80\x9d information. The MCNY and LinkNYC partnership is one of many programs that disseminate New York City\xe2\x80\x99s history; others include the NYC Space/Time Directory from the New York Public Library, an app from Urban Archive that made more than 2,500 images of old New York available on-the-go, and a Civil Rights & Social Justice Map from the Greenwich Village Society.\nLinkNYC\nMCNY\nPublic Art\nRelated Stories\nJune 21, 2019\nOur (Enclosed) Town\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nJune 6, 2019\nDisaster Dioramas\nArtist Josh Kline brings climate change home in a new Manhattan show\nJune 3, 2019\nCarpet Diem\nMiniature undulating cityscape comes to Madison Square Park\nMay 21, 2019\nSO-IL Meets Soil\nSO-IL and West 8 team up for an Artpark outside Buffalo, New York\nTrending\nMost Popular\nMost Recent\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nNational Trust for Historic Preservation names 2019\xe2\x80\x99s most endangered places\nDS+R and Rockwell Group\xe2\x80\x99s The Shed opens its massive guillotine doors\nJunya Ishigami reveals completed Serpentine Pavilion\nKnight Foundation announces its first class of Public Spaces Fellows\nConstruction begins on massive Machu Picchu airport despite protests\nTWA Hotel opens in JFK Airport\xe2\x80\x99s Eero Saarinen\xe2\x80\x93designed landmark\nFrench Senate declares Notre Dame must be rebuilt as it was before, quashing competition\nFrank Lloyd Wright cabin outside of Chicago faces demolition\nDetroit picks team to shape Midtown cultural center\nBefore the 2028 Olympics, L.A. embarks on its most transformative urban vision in a generation\nCarney Logan Burke Architects drops mutable performance pavilion in Jackson Hole\nSeattle makes affordable housing mandatory in upzoned neighborhoods\nHarvard\xe2\x80\x99s HouseZero is a live-in lab for sustainable renovation\nThomas Kelley reviews Virgil Abloh\xe2\x80\x99s mid-career retrospective\nCopyright 2019The Architect's Newspaper, LLCAll rights reserved.\nRegions\nInternational\nEast\nSoutheast\nMidwest\nWest\nSouthwest\nTopics\nAN Interior\nArchitecture\nArt\nDesign\nDevelopment\nPreservation\nTransportation\nUrbanism\nNewsletters\nFacades+\nSpec Sheet\nCity Terrain\nLate Edition: East\nLate Edition: West\nLate Edition: Midwest\nLate Edition: Southwest\nConferences\nFacades+ Conference\nFacades+ AM\nTech+\nInformation\nAwards\nAdvertise\nSubscribe\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nMap\nThe Architect's Newspaper, LLC | 21 Murray Street, 5th Floor | New York, NY 10007 | tel. 212.966.0630\nCopyright 2019, All rights reserved.", b'How TransitScreen helps city dwellers preserve a valuable asset: time\n| Smart Cities Dive\nCONTINUE TO SITE \xe2\x9e\x9e\nDeep Dive\nOpinion\nLibrary\nEvents\nJobs\nTopics\nMenu\nSign Up\nSearch\nSearch\nx\nEnergy & Utilities\nTransportation\nBuildings & Infrastructure\nEnvironment\nResilience\nGovernance\nTech & Data\nAn article from\nHow TransitScreen helps city dwellers preserve a valuable asset: time\nCEO and Co-founder Matt Caywood said by curating transit information, people can make better and more efficient mobility decisions.\nAuthor\nBy\nKristin Musulin\n@kristinmusulin\nPublished\nJune 21, 2018\nShare it\npost\nshare\ntweet\nTen years ago, in the neuroscience lab at the University of California, San Francisco, a graduate student was developing experiments involving an unlikely interest: transportation.\nMatt Caywood, a Chicago native, was always fascinated by public transit. He had previously built himself a trip planner for London Underground (a good four years prior to London launching its own planner), and at UCSF, he built his own tools to determine the most efficient transit options home after late nights of studying. This passion for tech-driven mobility solutions led Caywood to Washington, DC, where his infatuation with transportation transformed into a business.\nIn 2013, Caywood and co-founder Ryan Croft launched TransitScreen, a company that curates local, real-time mobility information \xe2\x80\x94 including bus and rail times, wait times for ride-sharing apps and the proximity of bike- and scooter-share systems \xe2\x80\x94 and displays it on screens in commercial buildings. The screens are located across more than 40 cities in the U.S. and Canada, with some even sprinkled throughout the U.K., Ireland and France.\nThe growth of TransitScreen followed a true startup trajectory, having started in Caywood\'s garage before moving to the former 1776 incubator, and eventually into its own office. Caywood describes the company as "scrappy" and touts its most strategic business decision \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0to sell to real estate clients.\nThe TransitScreen office in Washington, DC.\nKristin Musulin\n"The cities are advocates for us because we\xe2\x80\x99re helping them by providing public information that anyone, no matter who they are \xe2\x80\x94 young or old, rich or poor \xe2\x80\x94 can get,"\xc2\xa0Caywood said. "But what we do instead is work with the real estate industry and with employers to put that information into as many public and public-ish locations as possible."\nTransitScreen displays are most commonly found in commercial offices, apartment buildings, hotels, restaurants and university buildings.\n"It\'s a very different model from, say, a LinkNYC model where they have to spend hundreds of millions in capital costs to roll out their network then find a way to recoup that," Caywood explained. "We\'re able to make a very large impact on smart cities while still being a very small and lightly-funded company."\nReal-time data on the big screen\nBy offering transportation information on a public display, the TransitScreen team is aiming to preserve a valued asset of the everyday public transit user: time.\nA recent report from McKinsey Global Institute\xc2\xa0found that, by 2025, the cities that deploy smart mobility applications could reduce average commuting times by 15-20%. "When a resident looks at real-time traffic data and decides to set out at a less busy time, she avoids adding another car to the road that would worsen congestion for everyone," the report says.\xc2\xa0"Millions of individual decisions and actions add up, making the city as a whole more productive and responsive."\nTransitScreen\nCaywood said by giving city residents the option to view this real-time data right before walking out of the door, it alleviates the responsibility of looking up the information on your mobile device. And, while TransitScreen has optimized its service to be responsive to a mobile screen, Caywood said only one in every 10 public transit riders ever checks their phone for such information.\n"Most of the trips that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make are starting at a particular location \xe2\x80\x94 your home or your work. Being able to provide the information at a glance in an efficient and easy-to-use manner, that\xe2\x80\x99s when you have the biggest impact," he said.\nOf course the company faces a lot of pressure to keep its information accurate and up-to-date as new mobility solutions enter the market. Caywood said this is a "core goal of our product," and is accomplished through active partnerships.\n"Our approach is we want to work with all of the different mobility providers to inform our audience ... about the options that are available and the choices that they can now make," he said. "So our approach to that has been to partner with them, and we\'re now seeing that as we\'ve established our presence in the space, people are kind of now coming to us with data and saying, \'What does it take to get on TransitScreen\'s platform?\'"\nEven with the influx of new electric scooter and dockless bike companies coming online, Caywood said TransitScreen is in "active conversations" with everyone in the space.\nRanking a location with MobilityScore\nIn addition to the traditional TransitScreen platform, the company has also developed MobilityScore, a tool that ranks city locations based on access to mobility services. Similar to tools like Walk Score, MobilityScore measures how easy it is to move around a city by scoring any location or address from 0 (no mobility options) to 100 (excellent mobility options).\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s based on actual data and not just schedules, so it\xe2\x80\x99s the only tool of its kind,"\xc2\xa0Caywood said. And while the tool is only in its beta phase, it has already been rolled out in most of the top 100 largest cities in North America. The company has also worked with real estates sites like Rent Jungle to optimize property and rental searches.\nCaywood called MobilityScore an "intrinsically international product" and said TransitScreen will continue to roll out the tool in new places.\xc2\xa0In a blog post,\xc2\xa0the company also called the tool "future-proof" and said it will be continuously updated with information on microtransit, autonomous vehicles and mobility-as-a-service.\nThe MobilityScore results for a location in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, DC.\nTransitScreen\nLooking forward\nFrom its active social media accounts to regular e-mail newsletters, TransitScreen is vocal about its desire to grow alongside the cities where it operates. Caywood hinted the company has a few new offerings in the works, and is continually looking for ways to "make the TransitScreen experience more relevant to the people who are viewing it and using it."\nAnd aside from internal strategies,\xc2\xa0Caywood believes the evolution of smart cities will help the company stay along a successful growth path. He said his understanding of a "smart city" is one that takes data and translates it into useful information \xe2\x80\x94 which is at the core of TransitScreen\'s business.\n"We started with this unique public information solution but we\xe2\x80\x99re really taking it to wherever people are making decisions based on mobility," he said. "There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole different side of smart cities that people don\'t even think about because we\xe2\x80\x99re so caught up in stage one, which is data collection. Stage two is where, say Waze starts changing traffic patterns and you have to start thinking what to do with it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the interesting part and that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of where the future of smart cities is going. So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re pointed to.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFollow\nKristin Musulin\non\nTwitter\nshare\ntweet\npost\nemail\nprint\nFiled Under:\nTransportation\nTech & Data\nTop image credit:\nTransitScreen\nGet smart cities news like this in your inbox daily.

This digital exhibit is a follow up to the release of their book, \xe2\x80\x98Never Built New York,\xe2\x80\x99 which came out in 2016, and their subsequent exhibition at the Queens Museum last fall.\nIn the LinkNYC partnership, these never built projects will be displayed as close as possible to their would be locations in the city. Take for instance I.M. Pei\xe2\x80\x99s Hyperboloid, a 102-story circular tower that would have replaced Grand Central Terminal, and would have been the tallest structure in the world\xe2\x80\x94that will be visible on LinkNYC kiosks near the station.\nOther never built structures that have received recognition on LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s digital billboards include Moshe Safdie\xe2\x80\x99s Habitat New York 1, an origami-like luxury residence and shopping complex proposed to rise north of Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side; and the domed stadium designed by Buckminster Fuller, that would have kept the Dodgers in Brooklyn. Peek at some of the others below.\nThis is LinkNYC\xe2\x80\x99s latest collaboration following ones with the Museum of the City of New York in March, to honor women activists; and the one with the Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS) last year to show off historic photos of NYC neighborhoods.\nThe New York City transit projects that never were\nHelp bring a \xe2\x80\x98Never Built New York\xe2\x80\x99 exhibit to life at the Queens Museum\nNext Up In\nNews\nNew York Botanical Garden\xe2\x80\x99s stinky corpse flower will bloom soon\nDigital billboards should be banned from NYC waterways: lawmakers\nNew York lawmakers vote to legalize e-bikes, e-scooters\nInfamous landlord to pay $3M in tenant harassment settlement\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nBrooklyn lawmaker wants to resurrect Triboro rail line\nMost Read\nWilliamsburg\xe2\x80\x99s quirky shipping container house lists for $5.5M\nThe home on a corner lot is made up of 21 shipping containers meticulously pieced together\nWhat $1M buys in NYC right now\nFive apartments, five NYC neighborhoods\nLovely Ditmas Park townhouse with a huge pool asks $2M\nThe landmarked Brooklyn home has a ton of "old world charm."\nNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home now a $4,000/month rental\nThe apartment where the late rapper grew up is up for grabs\nNYC\xe2\x80\x99s 25 most expensive homes for sale\nHere now, check out the 25 most expensive listings in NYC\xe2\x80\x94they\'re just as ridiculously over-the-top as you might expect.\nSign up for the\nCurbed NY Newsletter\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 33.

LinkNYC, the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications, AN contributor Sam Lubell, writer\xc2\xa0Greg Goldin, and publisher Metropolis Books have teamed up to bring images from Never Built New York to the city\xe2\x80\x99 streets via LinkNYC kiosks.\nThe display of unbuilt megaprojects from some of the biggest names in architecture follows the release of the Never Built New York book in 2016, and the accompanying show at the Queens Museum last fall. The kiosks won\xe2\x80\x99t display the full array of weird and wild never-realized projects, but the curated images will still depict how New York could have grown into a very different city.\nA kiosk display of Howe & Lescaze\xe2\x80\x99s unbuilt Museum of Modern Art. (Courtesy LinkNYC)\nSome of the work on display includes I.M. Pei\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for the Hyperboloid, a 102-story tower proposed in 1954 that would have replaced Grand Central, and Robert Moses\xe2\x80\x99s heavily contested Mid-Manhattan Expressway. Images of the Dodger Dome, an enclosed stadium designed by Buckminster Fuller meant to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn, and Moshe Safdie\xe2\x80\x99s tessellating Habitat New York (originally slated for the Upper East Side) have also been selected. LinkNYC will display images of each project on kiosks close to the location where they would have risen.\nA kiosk display of William Zeckendorf\xe2\x80\x99s 67-block-long Dream Airport, which would have floated in the Hudson River.

Intersection, the company behind LinkNYC and LinkNWK public Wi-Fi kiosks in New York City and Newark, N.J., is now offering an app to secure connections on its networks.\nThe Link Wi-Fi App will provide an encrypted connection between the device and the network and will ensure that devices don\xe2\x80\x99t connect to other \xe2\x80\x9cevil twin\xe2\x80\x9d networks, which would allow bad actors to steal and view user information, Stacey Levine, the VP of communications at Intersection, told GCN.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only sure-fire way to avoid these evil-twin networks is to use a secure method of network access such as an app and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of the encrypted app.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe security of public Wi-Fi networks is increasingly an area of focus for cities who want to protect their residents and visitors from hackers, imposter networks and other threats that can compromise or steal user data, often without users even realizing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection President Jen Hensley said. \xe2\x80\x9cUnlike many public wifi networks, the LinkNWK network will ensure a secure, encrypted connection for all Apple and Android phones through the Link Wi-Fi app.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLinkNWK will be the first city to have the app when it activates its 45 kiosks later this fall, Levine said.\nLinkNYC has both a public and private network. LinkNYC Private requires downloading a Hotspot 2.0 profile that enables encryption and automatically connects users from one hotspot to the next without requiring them to log in to each new network. It also recently signed a deal with Quad9 to secure its guest and free public Wi-Fi networks by blocking access to known malicious sites.\nLink Wi-Fi App will instead be downloaded like any standard smartphone app, a process users are more familiar with, Levine said, and it will be available for iOS and Android users.\nThe app will automatically connect a device to the LinkNWK network any time it is within range. It will also provide a map of nearby active kiosks. Future updates could provide the ability to access information similar to what people can see on the kiosks themselves -- including events, city information and transit updates.\nThis app will also give Intersection data for monitoring internet connectivity. Analysts will be able to see when people have trouble connecting and if the problem is due to a specific operating system or device, which will help the service to troubleshoot, Levine said.\nLinkNWK taps into Newark's fiber network for internet connectivity. For LinkNYC, Intersection has invested in a \xc2\xa0purpose-built fiber optic network for gigabit connectivity.\nThe company also is in talks with the other cities with Link kiosks about rolling out this app to those locations, Levine said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFundamentally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cconnectivity is kind of like the basis of smart city technology. Things need to be connected, people need access to communication, so we think this is a foundational piece of their smart city efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAbout the Author\nMatt Leonard is a former reporter

The plan was to spend $200 million installing as many as 10,000 kiosks, or Links, that would supply free, encrypted gigabit Wi-Fi to passers-by within 150 feet. They would have buttons that link directly to 911 and New York\xe2\x80\x99s 311 service and free USB charging stations for smartphones, plus wired handsets that would allow free calls to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. And perhaps best of all, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the city a dime; advertising would subsidize expansion and ongoing maintenance.\nThe\xc2\xa0Links wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just get urbanites\xc2\xa0online and let them juice their phones, though. The idea was to engage users, too, principally with twin 55-inch high-definition displays and tethered Android tablets with map functions. Mike Gamaroff, head of innovation at Kinetic, characterized the Links in 2016 as \xe2\x80\x9cfirst and foremost a utility for the people of the city, that also doubles up as an advertising network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTwo years after the deployment of prototypical kiosks in Manhattan, Intersection \xe2\x80\x94 a part of the aforementioned CityBridge, which with Qualcomm and CIVIQ Smartscapes manages the kiosks \xe2\x80\x94 is ready to declare them a success. The roughly 1,600 Links recently hit three milestones: 1 billion sessions, 5 million users, and 500,000 phone calls a month.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an opportunity to communicate with people as they navigate their day,\xe2\x80\x9d Intersection senior consumer marketing manager Amanda Giddon told VentureBeat in a phone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mandate is to help make Link a part of the community through content and content strategy \xe2\x80\x94 really, anything that [makes] New Yorkers feel like tourists in their own city [or] even help tourists feel like New Yorkers through useful, actionable information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCreative content\nAt any given time, the Link kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 screens host news headlines from the Associated Press, comics, weather info, real-time alerts from the Office of Emergency Management, and creative from a mix of roughly 50 other campaigns. Also on tap are hundreds of hyperlocal factoids\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cNYC Fun Facts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis Day in New York\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about people (\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Hildebrandt opened the United States\xe2\x80\x99 first tattoo business in New York City in 1870\xe2\x80\x9d), places (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a superhero supply store in Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x9d), and things (\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City gets 15 times more snow than the South Pole each year\xe2\x80\x9d). There are close to 400 trivia tidbits in all, with new ones joining the collection each week.\nGibbon researches the facts herself, typically spending a few hours a week\xc2\xa0poring through a range of sources, including Broadway.org, Grow NYC, Time Magazine, FiveThirtyEight, and the\xc2\xa0National History Museum. She dutifully fact-checks them and copies them to a master spreadsheet before deciding which ones will make the cut.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been really great to see people writing in about the content they see.\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve created some moments of awe for people, and if I can create a moment of awe for someone on a daily basis, then I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my job right,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Giddon said.\nWhen the kiosks aren\xe2\x80\x99t alerting pedestrians to, say, the percentage of New Yorkers riding elevators at any time, they display real-time bus arrivals and local maps. But the bulk of their programming consists of rotating regular, seasonal, and limited-time content collaborations with organizations, publications, and government agencies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe survey our users quite frequently [for ideas] \xe2\x80\xa6 and we go to great lengths to make sure our [content] is contextually relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giddon. \xe2\x80\x9c[We\xe2\x80\x99re] pioneering this publishing approach and public space and are really eager to get feedback and adjust as we continue to expand.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne recent example is a partnership with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) that showcased the work of local artists. Another is \xe2\x80\x9cPopular Places Near You,\xe2\x80\x9d a Foursquare-powered feature that shows top restaurants and entertainment hubs within walking distance.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the tip of the iceberg. Intersection worked with the Museum of the City of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Beyond Suffrage exhibit to feature NYC women in politics, with the NYC Department of Records to curate historical photography (localized at a neighborhood level), and with Silicon Harlem and Global Kids to showcase legendary\xc2\xa0African Americans\xc2\xa0during Black History Month.\nSocial services\nIntersection\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0also leveraging the kiosks to promote civic engagement.\nIn April, it teamed up with the New York City Council to roll out Participatory Budgeting New York City, which let residents as young as 11 vote via the kiosk tablets on how the city will allocate its $40 million public budget. And it launched an awareness campaign to get New Yorkers registered to vote in advance of the November 2018 general elections. (The latter integrated with the city\xe2\x80\x99s voter registration data to show a real-time count of the number of people signed up.) It also posts Community Board meeting notices and local road closures and through its LinkLocal program lets small businesses advertise for free on select kiosks around the city.\nIntersection has experimented with social services, too. In January, users were able to browse and enroll in health plans through New York State of Health insurance marketplace.\nFor some New Yorkers, the Link hubs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a convenience \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re a lifeline. A 2014 study by the Office of the New York City Comptroller found that 27 percent of NYC residents surveyed \xe2\x80\x94 40 percent of whom had less than a high school education \xe2\x80\x94 lacked broadband internet at home.\nWithout a reliable internet connection, students can\xe2\x80\x99t access online classroom resources, out-of-work adults can\xe2\x80\x99t submit job applications, and families struggling to make ends meet can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of social services. As the New York Times wrote in August 2016:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn urban areas, rural areas, and everywhere in between, students who lack internet service at home have difficulty doing their nightly schoolwork. Many of them cobble together whatever connectivity they can, picking up free Wi-Fi signals in front of libraries, in school parking lots, and at fast-food restaurants.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFour years ago, De Blasio\xc2\xa0touted the Links as a sign of progress in the fight for unimpeded internet access. \xe2\x80\x9c[They\xe2\x80\x99re] the fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[and] a critical step toward a more equal, open, and connected city for every New Yorker, in every borough.\xe2\x80\x9d\nControversy\nBut the accolades tend to ignore the fact that LinkNYC isn\xe2\x80\x99t strictly a philanthropic effort. Advertisements that run alongside Intersection\xe2\x80\x99s programming were expected to generate between $500 million and a billion dollars over the next 12 years. (CityBridge and the city split the ad revenue equally.)\nAnd the kiosks themselves aren\xe2\x80\x99t without controversy.\nThe connected tablets initially had an internet browser, but Intersection disabled it in response to complaints about users browsing pornographic material. It also added vision-assistance tools after the National Federation of the Blind sued the City of New York and LinkNYC, arguing that the tablets lacked basic accessibility features.\nRevenue, meanwhile, has missed expectations.\xc2\xa0Over the first two years, the city collected $43.4 million in payments, narrowly beating the $42.5 million minimum CityBridge guaranteed. Under an amended deal, CityBridge will delay paying the city its share of revenues (above the minimum payments) until the last year of the contract, when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be due with 10 percent interest.\nAnd as The Intercept recently pointed out, consumer advocacy groups and activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Stop LinkNYC, and ReThink LinkNYC, have brought attention to the hubs\xe2\x80\x99 potential for mass surveillance.\nEach hub is equipped with three cameras and sensors capable of, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor[ing] pedestrian, bike, and car traffic; track[ing] passing wireless devices; listen[ing] to street noise; and \xe2\x80\xa6 identify[ing] abandoned packages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNone of this has scared away investors, who extended $150 million in financing to Intersection last year.\nIntersection makes clear in its privacy policy that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collect information about users\xe2\x80\x99 precise locations. And in response to recent allegations that it intends to track Wi-Fi users\xe2\x80\x99 real-time positions, it said it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0collect their clickstream data or browsing history.\nAs Intersection and CityBridge eye expansion to new markets, Giddon said, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take into account feedback they\xe2\x80\x99ve received so far.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be a combination of lessons learned and ensuring we add a little local flavor [to our programing],\xe2\x80\x9d Giddon said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe have research teams in New York and Philadelphia who\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted some preliminary focus group testing to understand how to best serve the community. We\xe2\x80\x99re really open to feedback, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work here and look forward to seeing how it\xe2\x80\x99s received.\nIntersection hopes to install 7,500 Link kiosks by 2026, when its contract with the city expires. In June, it launched InLinkUK, a partnership with telecom provider BT and outdoor advertising agency Primesight to replace over 1,000 pay phones in major U.K. cities with kiosks. In September, 100 kiosks\xc2\xa0hit the sidewalks of Philadelphia as part of its LinkPHL program. And by the end of this year, 45 will come to Newark.", b"NYC will roll out thousands more kiosks offering free public Wi-Fi\nGo to the content\nGo to the footer\nClose\nNew York\nChange city\nNew York\n(en)\nEnglish\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\nPopular cities\nLondon\nNew York\nParis\nChicago\nLos Angeles\nLisbon\nHong Kong\nSydney\nMelbourne\nPorto\nSingapore\nBarcelona\nMadrid\nGirona\nBrowse all cities\nTickets\nEvents\nThings to Do\nTime Out Market\nRestaurants\nBars\nMovies\nTheater\nKids\nArt\nNews\nAttractions\nVideo\nHotels\nTravel\nMusic\nTO Book\nClasses\nMuseums\nShopping\nNightlife\nComedy\nDance\nLGBT\nSex & Dating\nBooks\nCity Guide\nNeighborhoods\nMagazine\nSweepstakes\nVenue Rental\nTime Out New York\nNew York\nEnglish\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\nPopular cities\nLondon\nNew York\nParis\nChicago\nLos Angeles\nLisbon\nHong Kong\nSydney\nMelbourne\nPorto\nSingapore\nBarcelona\nMadrid\nGirona\nBrowse all cities\nSubscribe\nLove Time Out?\nGet the best of your city in our newsletter, as often as you like\nD\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu!

Brought to you by Microsoft\nPosted: Monday October 15 2018, 12:53pm\nPhotograph: Courtesy LinkNYC\nWhen the sleek, black LinkNYC kiosks began popping up around New York in 2016, it felt sort of like the opening scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Technologically advanced monoliths from the future had suddenly materialized to drag us all into the future. Two years later, the internet-connected sidewalk kiosks\xe2\x80\x94which offer free Wi-Fi, free calling and USB ports to charge devices\xe2\x80\x94can boast\xc2\xa0more than 5 million registered Wi-Fi users who log an average of 20 million free sessions a week. Additionally, 500,000 phone calls are made on the kiosks every month.\nSo can we look forward to a sunny future where we can all cancel our private internet plans and log onto a free public network that blankets the city?\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, no. \xe2\x80\x9cLinkNYC kiosks are primarily designed for commercial corridors,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Kate Blumm, Assistant Commissioner at the NYC Department of Information Technology. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just one piece of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s larger plan to bring affordable high-speed internet to every New Yorker by 2025.\xe2\x80\x9d Additionally, the 1,700 kiosks that have been installed across the five boroughs (of a planned 7,500) only offer a Wi-Fi range of about 150 feet.\nWhen NYC originally conceptualized the project that eventually became LinkNYC, it was looking for a modern replacement for the city\xe2\x80\x99s aging payphone infrastructure. The winning proposal, from CityBridge, envisioned futuristic metal totems spread out across all five boroughs with giant, high-res screens on either side. Advertisements shown on the screens would then cover the cost of the kiosks themselves, and the city would be gifted with free, fast Wi-Fi infrastructure. To date, however, some of the most compelling uses of the kiosks have come from those screens rather than the Wi-Fi.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were surprised by how many people have been using them to make calls when everyone has cell phone, but a big part of the kiosks has been the content we display on the screens,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jennifer Hensley, the president of Link. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re able to provided curated content to help people make the most of their city through partnerships with local government and cultural institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s ranged from a recent initiative where New Yorkers could literally register to vote using the kiosks to information on good restaurants to hit up in the area, fun facts about the city and details on upcoming local events that those passing by might want to attend.\nOne of the criticisms of the kiosks from privacy advocates has been the inclusion of two cameras above the displays (along with a third camera above the tablet which could possibly be used for video calling in the future). Hensley insists, however, that the cameras above the New York devices are primarily for monitoring the structures themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re expensive pieces of hardware out on the streets so we want to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re safe,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\nAlong with the addition of thousands of more kiosks in the coming years, Hensley predicts that the devices will play a large part in coming years with helping New Yorkers have all the information they need to be counted in the 2020 census. However, by that time, Link will be helping more than just New Yorkers. The company has plans to expand into Newark this\xc2\xa0week\xc2\xa0and will soon spread to Philadelphia by the end of the year.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising\nShare\nTweet\nGuest blogger\nBy Will Gleason.

Oct. 16, 2018. (Courtesy: City of Newark)\nBy Karen Yi | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\nNew digital kiosks with 55-inch screens have\xc2\xa0sprouted across the city of Newark\xc2\xa0that will allow passers-by to make free phone calls, connect to public Wifi or charge their mobile devices.Newark is the first in New Jersey to\xc2\xa0launch the LinkNWK sidewalk\xc2\xa0kiosks\xc2\xa0created by\xc2\xa0Intersection, a New York-based technology company. New York City was the first to roll out the technology in 2016 and Philadelphia will install the kiosks later this fall.\nOn Tuesday, officials debuted\xc2\xa0the newly-installed\xc2\xa0kiosks across from the\xc2\xa0Prudential Center on Broad Street. A\xc2\xa0total of 45 kiosks will be in operation in the city -- with at least one in every ward. So far, two are up and running."Newark is once again defining itself to the state, nation, and world as a cutting-edge, high-tech city," Mayor Ras Baraka said. "These kiosks will enable residents and visitors alike to gain immediate information about Newark, ranging from upcoming cultural events to emergency service response."The kiosks, which Intersection installed at no cost to the city, display information on city services, fun facts about Newark, upcoming events and advertisements.The ad revenue will go to the company and be shared with the city as well.Representatives at\xc2\xa0Intersection said this time, the kiosks will not allow internet browsing. When the devices were first installed in New York City people used the kiosks to watch pornography, according to reports at the time.\nLinkNWK kiosk on Broad Street. Oct. 16, 2018. (Courtesy: City of Newark)\nThe company has not announced plans to install kiosks in any other New Jersey cities.The Newark kiosks will be the first to roll out with a Wifi app that allows users to connect to the LinkNWK network and pull up a map to find the nearest kiosk.\nNJIT has also partnered with Intersection\xc2\xa0to find creative ways of using the devices to benefit the community."Newark is a rising star in the tech economy, and we are proud that LinkNWK will only add to this momentum," said Jen Hensley, President of Link at Intersection.A minority investor in Intersection is Sidewalk Labs, which was created by Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

The kiosks nominally serve as public Wi-Fi hotspots, USB charging stations, free-to-use telephones and touchscreen directories of city services. Last April, DoITT added real-time bus schedules\xc2\xa0to the kiosks\xe2\x80\x99 displays, and is now using them to showcase the photography exhibition.\nThe exhibit, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Dugout with Jackie Robinson: An Intimate Portrait of a Baseball Legend,\xe2\x80\x9d includes 32 photographs of Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year MLB career and personal life. The pictures were originally shot for Look magazine by photographers Kenneth Eide and Frank Bauman, but never published. The scenes include Robinson on and off the field at Ebbets Field, in the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse and at home with his wife, Rachel.\nJackie and Rachel Robinson with their three-year-old son, Jackie Jr., at home in Brooklyn, 1949. (Frank Bauman / Museum of the City of New York)\nWhile the full exhibit, which also includes memorabilia and the Robinson family\xe2\x80\x99s home movies, is on display at the Museum of the City of New York through Sept. 15, the LinkNYC kiosks will be rotating through the photos until Feb. 28, as part of the city\xe2\x80\x99s commemoration of Black History Month. A museum dedicated to Robinson, who died in 1972, is scheduled to open in December.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat better way to celebrate Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s rich legacy, life and career in New York in a way that everyone walking down the street can enjoy,\xe2\x80\x9d Samir Saini, New York\xe2\x80\x99s chief information officer, said in a press release.\n-In this Story-\nJackie Robinson, LinkNYC\nRelated news\nCity\nLos Angeles city controller updates online property map to boost housing, economy\nby Colin Wood \xe2\x80\xa2 2 days ago\nCity\n'Bootcamp' program aims to boost New York City's cybersecurity workforce\nby Benjamin Freed \xe2\x80\xa2 2 days ago\nCity\nDetroit kicks off Ford-backed transportation challenge\nby Ryan Johnston \xe2\x80\xa2 2 days ago\nAd Specs\nSponsor\nRSS\nPrivacy Policy\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Scoop News Group\n|\nAll Rights Reserved\nSearch for:\nThe latest state and local government tech news, delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.
